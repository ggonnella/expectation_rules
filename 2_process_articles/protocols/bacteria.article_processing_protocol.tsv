	19805210	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	The genomic basis of trophic strategy in marine bacteria	www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19805210	Y	80%		X	x	copiotrophs are enriched in COGs involved in motility (N), defense mechanisms (V), transcription (K), and signal transduction (T) 
						80%		X	x	Consistent with predictions by Poindexter (14) that copiotrophic bacteria are likely to display an extensive range of cellular responses to environmental stimuli, regulators with FOG:GGDEF domains (COG2199) and FOG:EAL domains (COG2200) are more abundant in copiotrophs.
						60%		X	x	Copiotrophic genomes also contain significantly more acetyltransferases of the isoleucine patch superfamily (COG0110).
						80%		X	x	oligotrophs are enriched in COGs for lipid transport and metabolism (I) and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism (Q).
						80%		X	x	A large array of gene families involved in the degradation of fatty acids is consistently overrepresented in oligotroph genomes, including COG0183 (acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase), COG0318 (acyl-CoA synthetases (AMP-forming)/AMP-acid ligases II), COG1024 (enoyl-CoA hydratase/carnithine racemase), COG1804 (acyl-CoA transferase/carnitine dehydratase), and COG1960 (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase).
						80%		X	x	Similarly, the oligotroph genome dataset consistently has a high number  of genes within COG0625 (GST) that are involved in detoxification  reactions, the degradation of xenobiotic compounds, and the catabolism  of recalcitrant compounds for carbon and energy, and other gene groups  (COG0179, COG1680, COG3485) involved in the degradation of several  aromatic substrates including β-lactamic compounds, tyrosine, and  catechol.
						80%		X	x	Copiotroph genomes also contain more repeats within clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs).
						90%		X	x	The Planctomycetes are characterized by interesting genomic traits, having a single copy of the rRNA operon (a feature of oligotrophs), while also possessing large genomes (a feature of copiotrophs).
13.12.2021								added	x	Specific clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) that were consistently overrepresented in copiotrophs included components of phosphotransferase systems (PTS) that are central for regulation and transport of sugars (COG1263, COG1299), Na+ transporters (COG0733), and a wide array of other highly specific transporters (COG0697, COG1292, COG2116, COG2704) and permeases (COG0697, COG0814, COG1114, COG1275, COG1972, COG2271, COG3104).
								added	x	The genomic analysis showed an overrepresentation across all copiotrophic datasets of enzymes such as chitinases (COG3325) and collagenases (COG0826).
								added	x	genomes of copiotrophs are overrepresented in highly efficient dissimilatory selenocysteine-containing dehydrogenases (COG0243), and to a lesser extent, components of alternative electron transport chains including COG0716 (flavodoxins), COG2863 (cytochrome c553), and COG3005 (nitrate/trimethylamine N-oxide reductases, membrane-bound tetraheme cytochrome c subunit).
								added	x	The capacity of copiotrophs to rapidly and tightly regulate metabolism and use energetically expensive transporters for nutrient acquisition is consistent with the presence of a high proportion of COGs related to transcription and signal transduction. A particularly strong bias is evident for COG0583 (transcriptional regulator), COG2207 (AraC-type DNA-binding domain-containing proteins), and COG3710 [DNA-binding winged-helix–turn–helix (HTH) domains].
								added	x	In addition to catabolic genes, genes involved in fatty acids biosynthesis are overrepresented in oligotrophs; i.e., most of the genes belonging to COG1028 are dehydrogenases with different specificities for short-chain alcohols.
								added	x	In addition, cytochrome P450 genes (COG2124) are present in S. alaskensis RB2256 (six copies) and absent in P. angustum S14, and the high frequency by which these genes occur is a conserved feature of oligotroph genomes.

							(Information storage and processing) COG-analysis 	X		In ‘ISP’, the distribution of genes across all mycobacterial proteomes is almost consistent for translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (J) and chromatin structure and RNA processing (B), while a clear genomic fluidity is exhibited by the genes belonging to replication, recombination and repair (L).
								X	x	In case of carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G), all mycobacterial species have almost an equal representation except M. smgematis
								X	x	we observe that saprophytic mycobacterium like MIP has only 38 transposons-like elements compared with 302 found in similar-sized pathogenic mycobacterial species M. ulcerans .
								X	x	The presence of PPE gene family is unique to mycobacteria among prokaryotes
								X	x	magnetotactic bacteria, which are also endowed with the abundance of hemerythrins
							M. tuberculosis complex (including M. marinum and M. ulcerans ) and M. avium complex	X	x	thiocyanate gene cluster is absent from all the pathogenic mycobacteria
								X	x	Thus, despite having PE-PPE genes and mce1 operon, which enable mycobacteria to invade the host cell, MIP lacks both mce2 and mce3 operons, which are essential for causing macrophage infections by M. tuberculosi s and M. avium
								X		Likewise, MIP lacks phospholipase ( plc ) ABCD genes, which are responsible for acquiring host fatty acids for their use as a potential carbon source during persistent infections both in tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections ( 79 ).
								X		Another factor crucial for mycobacterial pathogenicity is associated with the presence of latency-related genes that confer on mycobacteria the ability to survive and grow in microaerophilic environment for prolonged period of time.
								replaced	x	We could also identify putative homologs of ‘ hr’ genes in mycobacteria such as M. marinum and M. ulcerans (1 each), M. tuberculosis ( 3 ), M . gilvum and M. smegmatis (4 each), M. avium complex ( 5 ), other environmental mycobacteria like M. sps . KMS , M. sps. JLS and M. vanabaalenii (three each) and none in the case of M. leprae .

Hopanoids are pentacyclic compounds that are similar to eukaryotic cholesterol in terms of their structure and function. Indeed, there is a report on the production of hopanoids by Methylobacterium [63].
							Species-specific			One interesting feature is that some completely sequenced Methylobacterium species have the pqqABC/DE genes as an operon, but in other species the pqqA gene is present separately.
							Species-specific			M. nodulans and Methylobacterium sp. 4–46 mainly exist in the rhizosphere, and are the only species that can fix atmospheric nitrogen with the presence of nif genes.
							Species-specific			M. oryzae and M. radiotolerans, not having the nitrogen-fixing genes, have many plant growth promotion-related genes including the accD gene, two genes encoding phytase, PQQ biosynthesis genes, the miaA gene, cobalamin-biosynthetic genes, and the C-P lyase system.
							Species-specific			Two phyllosphere groups that contain M. oryzae, M. radiotolerans and M. extorquens have more genes for signal transduction mechanisms (T) and cell motility (N) than the rhizosphere group that contain M. nodulans and Methylobacterium sp. 4–46. On the other hand, the rhizosphere group has more genes for secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism (Q).
									x	Methylotrophs are of polyphyletic origin [113], and the mxa gene cluster which is one of the major methylotrophy gene clusters is highly conserved among methylotrophs, including M. oryzae, that even belong to the Gamma- or Betaproteobacteria.

									x	Most Geobacteraceae, which do not utilize glucose and galactose, possess only a putative glucose 6-kinase (Gbem_1326) similar to those of Streptomyces lividans and Streptomyces coelicolor[32, 33], a UDP-glucose/galactose 4-epimerase (Gbem_3215) and a different putative galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase.

This pathway involves over 30 different steps, but only a few enzymes require vitamin B12 as cofactor, including methylmalonyl CoA mutase (MCM, EC 5.4.99.2) and methionine synthase H (MetH, EC 2.1.1.13). Both enzymes are encoded in the genomes of B. apis and B. tamiae, but are absent from the eubartonellae.
									x	Another group of conserved virulence factors, which show distinct patterns of evolution within the three major lineages of Bartonellae are hemin-binding proteins (Hbp).
	23190728	The ISME journal	By their genes ye shall know them: genomic signatures of predatory bacteria.	https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2012149					x	The most striking proteomic difference between predators and non-predators is in their method of synthesizing isoprenoids: all predators except M. aeruginosavorus encode genes coding for the mevalonate pathway but lack genes coding for the non-mevalonate (also known as the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate or DOXP) pathway, whereas the opposite is true for the non-predators.
									x	Another significant difference is found in the use of an archeal-eukaryotic GlyRS α2 dimer uncommon in Bacteria (Woese et al., 2000; Wolf et al., 1999), by all obligate and almost all facultative predators instead of the more frequent α2/β2 tetramer composed of two different subunits in non-predators.
									x	Accordingly, enzymes forming the DOXP pathway, which is used by plants, apicomplexan protozoa and most bacteria, are conspicuously absent from almost all predators and were detected as enriched for in non-predators.
	22717884	The ISME journal	Phaeobacter gallaeciensis genomes from globally opposite locations reveal high similarity of adaptation to surface life.	https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201262					x	Comparative genome analysis revealed that GTA-like structures are widespread among genomes of organisms affiliated with the Rhodobacterales (Lang and Beatty, 2007).
										The two Phaeobacter genomes possess 74 orthologous genes that are not present in other Roseobacter clade organisms using a 30% similarity cut-off based on a Needleman–Wunsch alignment (Supplementary Material S7). The majority of these genes have no functional annotation; however, two functions can potentially be used as unique chemotaxonomic markers for the species. These two gene markers were not found in the ANG1 draft genome, further supporting their potential uniqueness to P. gallaeciensis. The first refers to two copies of a chromosomally encoded D-alanine-poly(phosphoribitol) ligase (dltA), which is involved in biosynthesis of D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid.
									x	PFAM (protein family) motifs were identified in several of the proteins that are present in the dlt operon of Gram-positive bacteria (Glaser, 1995).
									x	The dltA genes are part of a larger cluster of 19 Phaeobacter unique genes (PGA1_c13610-PGA1_c13830 in DSM 17395).
									x	These ORFs share homology with the metH gene of Escherichia coli and with the S. meliloti betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase gene bmt, which represents a link between methionine biosynthesis and glycine betaine degradation in this organism (Barra et al., 2006).
									x	The Phaeobacter ORFs have only one-third of the size of metH and lack the cobalamin binding, the activation and the pterin-binding domains. Nevertheless, the vitamin B12-binding domains are encoded in ORFs (PGA1_c13350/PGA2_c13290) in the vicinity. The activation domain might be substituted by PGA1_c13360 (PGA2_c13300) that encodes a radical SAM domain (PF04055), which is thought to catalyze unusual methylation reactions (Sofia et al., 2001). Together, these three ORFs might code for enzymes that substitute both MetH, known from E. coli, and Bmt from S. meliloti. These genes and their arrangement are also present in other Roseobacter species

									x	Four to 23 putative OdmA encoding genes have been reported in D. hafniense, D. dehalogenans and D. dichloroeliminans, and none in D. metallireducens (Nonaka et al.2006; Kim et al.2012; Mingo, Studenik and Diekert 2014) (Fig. S6, Supporting Information; Table 3). Their occurrence in nearly all Desulfitobacterium spp. genomes suggests that O-methylated compounds are important electron donors for Desulfitobacterium spp.
									x	A cytoplasmic membrane-bound Ni-Fe hydrogenase (Hyf), found in all Desulfitobacterium spp., consists of six subunits, four of which are membrane integral. The corresponding gene cluster resembles the hyfBCEFGI components of the formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) 4 complex-encoding gene cluster (hyfABCDEFGHIR-focB) described for E. coli
									x	That said, unlike for E. coli, no formate-specific genes (e.g. the formate transporter focB) are found in the cluster, making the formation of an FHL complex in Desulfitobacterium unsure, despite the occurrence of a gene encoding a cytoplasmic formate dehydrogenase.
									x	We found that all analyzed genomes from Desulfitobacterium spp. encode intact cobalamin synthesis pathways, indicating that this is a general trait of this genus (Table 3). The synthesis pathway is organized similarly in all analyzed desulfitobacteria. It consists of three clusters (I–III) located separately in the genomes (Fig. 5). Cluster I encodes the proteins needed for synthesis of the basic ring structure from glutamyl-tRNA to sirohydrochlorin (also called factor II); cluster II encodes the steps starting from cobalt insertion until adenosyl cobinamide; and finally cluster III encodes all proteins needed for insertion of the lower ligand leading to cobalamin, with the exception of cobC that is located elsewhere in the genome
									x	All analyzed genomes of Desulfitobacterium spp. with the exception of D. dichloroeliminans encode one copy of the menFDHCEBIAG MK synthesis pathway

Genome analysis of ERDD5:01 showed occurrence of multiple copies of genes encoding for cold active chaperons and cold-shock inducible proteins (CspD, ClpB, GroEL, GroES, HscA/HscB, Hsp33, SurA, FliS, SecB, HtpG) (Table 2). Presence of such genes for Csps in higher copy number has been observed in other psychrotrophic bacteria such as Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis; Arthrobacter sp., and Bacillus psychrophilus

							paralogous		x	The genomes of five Rickettsia species (R. prowazekii, R. typhi, R. conorii, R. sibirica, and R. felis) exhibit chromosomal patatin-like phospholipase gene (pat1). Gene organization around pat1 is similar between these Rickettsia.

This is compatible with its asaccharolytic phenotype and is consistent with other asaccharolytic bacteria, such as Campylobacter jejuni, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica, in that glucokinase and 6-phosphofructokinase are also absent from their genomes [18],[19].

									x	(S. aureus) Finally, methicillin resistance is mediated through the mecA gene that encodes a penicillin binding protein to resist β-lactam antibiotics (81).
									x	Finally, antibiotic resistance in K. pneumoniae is further facilitated by multiple efflux pumps, including AcrAB and KexD of the RND family, KdeA of the MATE family, and KmrA of the MFS family (96–99)
										Furthermore, the transcriptomic profile analysis of P. aeruginosa in the presence of 0.3% (wt/vol) bile shows upregulation of genes associated with metabolism (siaAD) redox control, biofilm formation (psl), antibiotic tolerance (mexAB-oprM), and cell envelope biogenesis

									x	The pattern of amino acid distribution in γ-proteobacteria from different biotopes (Supplemental Fig. 3) displays an overall trend similar in the various genomes of interest, with leucine (L) being most abundant, while tryptophan (W), cysteine (C), histidine (H), and to a lesser extent methionine (M) are used infrequently. The proteome of the thermophilic genomes looks significantly different from that of the mesophilic and psychrophilic counterparts (strong avoidance of glutamine [Q] in thermophilic species, preference for alanine [A] in mesophilic and psychrophilic species, except in Oceanobacillus iheyensis).
									x	The most unexpected feature of the genome is the prominent absence of a RNA/nucleoid-associated cold-shock gene ubiquitous in γ-proteobacteria, hns.
									x	The existence of a complete set of genes (including hns) was also observed in other marine and cold-adapted bacteria, including S. oneidensis (Heidelberg et al. 2002) and D. psychrophila (Rabus et al. 2004).

Other Borrelia plasmid-encoded proteins of these sets, such as Pfam49, appear to be unique to this genus, are widely distributed on both linear and circular replicons, and presumably are also involved in replication and compatibility.
							plasmid DNA		x	The longer length of B. hermsii block I relative to B. turicatae block I is attributable to a higher number of repeated “P35” (Pfam54) homologs, a family of lipoproteins in LD Borrelia species (52).

BH72, as these two bacteria are currently the only diazotrophs among the endophytes sequenced. The result confirmed the presence in both endophytes of the nif cluster (figure 2, around 0.5 MB) and genes from the putative gum cluster are only conserved within Azoarcus sp. BH72 and GDI (Additional file 10).
										In bacteria, two porins (aqpZ and glpF) regulate the movement of water and aliphatic alcohols across cell membranes
									x	An unusual observation is the presence in the GDI genome of two copies of the chaperonin genes groES (GDI2050, GDI2648) and groEL (GDI2049, GDI2647), which are usually present as single copy in bacteria.
									x	Oxidation steps of ent-kaurene, necessary to produce GA1 and GA3, may be catalyzed by two cytochromes P450 (GDI2364 and GDI2593), homologs of which are absent in other acetobacteraceae genomes, thus suggesting a likely specific role in G. diazotrophicus.
										Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multi-subunit cell envelope-spanning structures, ancestrally related to bacterial conjugation machines, that transfer proteins, DNA and nucleoprotein complexes across membranes [61]. Moreover, T4SSs have been described as essential pathogenicity factors and recently it has been indicated that TSS4 can also increase host adaptability in Bartonella sp.
										GDI has 4 complete T4SS in the chromosome which are similar to bacterial conjugation machines (trb) of Agrobacterium tumefasciens [62] and Ti (tumor inducing) Enterobacter IncP plasmid R751
									x	Another difference is that, in Agrobacterium tumefasciens and Enterobacter IncP plasmid R751, the first gene in the operon is traI, which is an essential signal for the quorum-sensing regulation of the Ti plasmid conjugation transfer
									x	Next to the motility cluster there is a putative tad locus (Flp-1, cpaABC, cpaEF, and tadBCDG) which probably encodes the machinery for the synthesis of Flp (fimbrial low-molecular-weight protein) pili, which form a subfamily in the type IVb pilus family. In Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Pasteurella, Pseudomonas, Yersinia and Caulobacter. Flp pili are essential for biofilm formation, colonization and pathogenesis [68].
									x	Finally, comparison of genome sequences of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus and Azoarcus sp. BH72 shows that these endophytic diazotrophic bacteria adopted very different strategies to colonize plants. A limited number of genomic features, such as the large number of TonB receptors, the gum-like and nif clusters, and osmotolerance mechanisms are common to both endophytic diazotrophic bacteria.

In B. burgdorferi, dsrA has been shown to be involved in translational regulation of RpoS [71], ssrS binds to the RNA polymerase holoenzyme and regulates gene expression at the shift from exponential growth to stationary phase [72]. The genes ffs, dsrA and ssrS have previously not been annotated in any of the complete genomes of the different Borrelia species.
									x	Borrelia genomes contain an exceptional high number of lipoproteins.
									x	Many genes located on the conserved lp54 plasmid have low sequence identity across Borrelia species, among them are the genes encoding decorin binding proteins A and B (dbpA and dbpB, Pfam74) and the complement regulator-acquiring surface protein 1, CRASP-1, paralogous family 54 (Pfam54). 
									x	Even though multiple insertions and deletions occur at this location, the overall gene structure of the cp26 plasmids is highly conserved across Borrelia species, underlining the high importance of cp26.
										Besides the lower conservation of ospC, a certain degree of sequence variability is seen in several intergenic regions, most notably in a region upstream of oppAIV (coding for an extracellular solute-binding protein of an oligopeptide ABC transporter).
									x	Proteins with KID-repeats (IPR003900) are found on the cp32 and lp28 type plasmids of K78. These repeats contain the tripeptides KID and/or KIE, and are characteristic of the Bdr family (Pfam80), which are inner membrane proteins unique to Borrelia.

										Genes sqdB (encoding sulfolipid biosynthesis protein) and sqdX (encoding UDP-sulfoquinovose:DAG sulfoquinovosyltransferase) are required for synthesis of sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG) which is in turn required for photosystem stabilization (the product SQDB is usually found in thylakoid membranes) in other cyanobacteria, but is absent from G. violaceus PCC 7421T
										The Vipp1 protein is also known to be essential for the formation of thylakoid membrane in Synechocystis [22] and Arabidopsis thaliana [23], and has been detected in G. violaceus PCC 7421T, but the ortholog in PCC 7421T (which is annotated as phage shock protein, PspA) seems to be missing the conserved C-terminal region in its amino acid sequence, and is not expected to function the same way as Synechocystis or plant Vipp1 protein
										The biosynthesis pathway for neurosporene, a sub-class of that for trans-lycopene biosynthesis I, converts all-trans-phytoene to all-trans-neurosporene; this is utilized by purple non-sulfur bacteria such as Rhodobacter capsulatus and Rh. sphaeroides to produce the pigment spheroidene, required in the photoreaction center of these bacteria [26].

									x	By contrast, most genomes of Cupriavidus and Ralstonia strains encode putative transporters for carbohydrates.
									x	The presence of both two catalase and two superoxide dismutase genes in one genome is not unusual among Betaproteobacteria.

									x	In addition, a glycolate permease gene as found in Ralstonia/Cupriavidus strains is missing in QLW-P1DMWA-1.
									x	The genome shares several characteristics with genomes of marine oligotrophs [46]. This includes, for instance, the presence of only a single ribosomal operon, and underrepresentation of genes assigned to the COG categories N (cell motility and secretion), T (signal transduction), V (defense), and K (transcription). An overrepresentation of categories Q (secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism) and I (lipid transport and metabolism), however, was not observed (data not shown).
									x	Furthermore, the commonly relatively low G+C content of Polynucleobacter genomes (<50 mol% vs. >60 mol% for the majority of other Burkholderiaceae) as well as previous estimations of genome sizes [7] suggest that reduced genome sizes represent a common feature of Polynucleobacter bacteria.

Legumes symbioses: absence of Nod genes in photosynthetic bradyrhizobia.	https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1139548?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&	N				x	Synthesis of the Nod-factor chitin oligomer backbone requires the activity of three specific enzymes, encoded by the nodABC genes, which are present in all rhizobia characterized thus far.
									x	Nod factor signal molecules are recognized by plant kinases of the LysM-RLKs family, which, in turn, initiate a developmental program in the legume host resulting in the formation of the nodule structure. The ubiquitous presence of nod genes and Nod factors in all rhizobia led to the development of a universal “lock-and-key” hypothesis (5, 6), which states that all symbiotic legumes and rhizobia have host nodulation determinants and homologs of the known nodulation genes, respectively.
									x	According to their host specificity within different species of Aeschynomene, two groups of photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium have been described (8): Group I strains contain the common nodulation genes nodABC and form nodules on all stem-nodulating Aeschynomene species (9), whereas nodulation ability in group II strains is restricted to a few species, including A. sensitiva and A. indica. The nod genes have not been detected in group II strains.
									x	Most of the 1343 genes in common were homogeneously distributed on the genomes (Fig. 1), except for genes involved in photosynthesis, which were clustered in a 50-kb region. This region, designated the photosynthesis gene cluster (PGC), is common in purple photosynthetic bacteria.
										This is in contrast to all rhizobial genomes characterized to date (15–21), which have nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes clustered either on plasmids or in large chromosomal symbiotic islands, for example, as observed in B. japonicum USDA110 (see fig. S2).

										The presence of inteins in prokaryotes is rare but where they occur they are frequently located in ribonucleoside reductases as first seen in several Archaea [49] and the cyanobacterium Anabaena 7120
										CydX has recently been shown to be a third subunit of the membrane-bound enzyme in E. coli
										In Av-DJ the rnfA1 operon is followed by a cluster of 15 genes probably constituting a genome island for a potential Type IV secretion system (Avin_50750 to 50890) which were first identified in Vibrio cholerae, Burkholderia mallei and Pseudomonas aeruginosa

									x	Upregulation of genes encoding the cytochrome bd oxidase (PPA0175, cydB, PPA0176, cydA), a respiratory endoxidase, which, in Escherichia coli, favors survival under low oxygen tensions [31], was detected in the EP.
									x	This system could be a powerful way for P. acnes to counteract the acidification of the culture medium in the course of propionate formation, akin to Streptococcus suis and sourdough lactic acid bacteria, which use the ADI pathway to facilitate survival in acidic conditions
									x	The ADI pathway has also been reported to function as an additional energy conserving pathway during anaerobic growth of Bacillus licheniformis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ADP1 [9], the central metabolism study of both A. baumannii strains confirms the lack of several key enzymes: a glucokinase, proteins of a phosphotransferase transport system, a 6-phosphofructokinase and a pyruvate kinase. The latter activity which exists in Pseudomonas spp. seems to be a good marker to clearly delineate both genera. Few Acinetobacter isolates are able to grow on glucose as sole carbon source and this property was early used as a main criterion to classify Acinetobacter species [32]. The Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas glycolysis can certainly not be performed in Acinetobacter spp. given the lack of the previously mentioned enzymes.
										An alternative glycolytic route passing through the Entner-Doudoroff pathway was elucidated several decades ago [33]. It starts with glucose periplasmic oxidation and leads to pyruvate formation. All the genes required for this pathway were identified in the three Acinetobacter genomes.
										Only two reactions requiring coenzyme B12 as cofactor have been detected in the A. baumannii str. AYE genome. The first is a methionine synthase encoded by the gene metH (ABAYE2822) which also exists in A. baylyi. This B12-dependent reaction allows Acinetobacter to synthesize methionine via a non-essential alternative route. The second is the ethanolamine ammonia-lyase which is essential for ethanolamine catabolism. The two subunits of the corresponding protein are encoded by the eutB (ABAYE1458) and eutC (ABAYE1457) genes in strain AYE. These genes are missing in A. baylyi and eutC is disrupted in strain SDF.
									x	These findings suggest that OmpA proteins are ubiquitous in the Acinetobacter genus but also raise questions on their exact role.

									x	For example, “Ca. Amoebophilus asiaticus” has no pathways for cofactor biosynthesis and misses the genetic repertoire for the generation of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, a feature shared with rickettsiae and chlamydiae
									x	For this, “Ca. Amoebophilus asiaticus” might employ a mechanism similar to that of rickettsiae, since its genome encodes two putative phospholipases D (Aasi_0130 and Aasi_0227) with a high similarity (approximately 40% amino acid sequence identity) to the functionally characterized phospholipase D from Rickettsia spp., which is considered the major effector for vacuole exit
									x	Some other bacteria also encode ANK proteins but generally at much lower numbers (below 10 ANK proteins per genome) (30, 90, 128). Interestingly, those bacterial genomes with the highest numbers of ANK proteins are from intracellular bacteria (Fig. 2; see also Table S7 in the supplemental material), suggesting that this group of proteins plays a role in the interaction with eukaryotic cells.
									x	Interestingly, the domains potentially involved in host cell interaction described above, such as ANK repeats, LRR, SEL1 repeats, and F- and U-box domains, are among the most highly enriched domains in proteomes of amoeba-associated bacteria.

									x	A member of the family of contact-dependent haemolysins found in pathogenic Serpulina and Mycobacterium species11 (Cj0588), a putative integral membrane protein with a haemolysin domain (Cj0183) and a phospholipase (pldA) were also identified.

Cytochrome ba3/bo3-type ubiquinol oxidase is a member of the haeme–copper oxidase superfamily, which includes cytochrome c oxidase in aerobic respiration of mitochondria and aerobes.4
										Taken together with the phylogenetic analysis presented in Fig. 2, it appears that As. bogorensis and Ga. diazotrophicus gained an extra nuo gene, possibly by the horizontal gene transfer, and As. bogorensis and Go. oxydans lost one nuo operon that is common among AAB.

Candidatus L. asiaticus and Candidatus L. solanacearum both possess 2 out of the 12 enzymes required for phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis. To compensate, all three species possess a general L-amino acid ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter.

									x	Since then, genome projects of bacteria have predicted that type III PKSs are distributed widely not only in Streptomyces but also other various bacteria.
									x	For example, ArsB and ArsC, both of which are type III PKSs in Azotobacter vinelandii, catalyze the synthesis of alkylresorcinols and alkylpyrones, respectively, which are essential for encystment as the major lipids in the cyst membrane
										Together with the fact that a pair of genes encoding SrsA- and SrsB-like proteins is distributed widely in both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, we speculate that the phenolic lipids play a significant, but so far unrecognized, role in the biological membranes.

A chitinase, two cellulases, one amylase, a pectinase, and several proteases and lipases were among the polymer-degrading enzymes encoded on the chromosome. Additionally, the plasmid encodes a 1,4-β-cellobiosidase homolog.
									x	Genes related to the transport and metabolism of glycerol and glycine betaine (the most common compatible solutes found in more moderate halophiles and halotolerant species) were also present.
									x	Like the haloarchaea, Salinibacter has all of the genes for a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle and a cytochrome c-containing respiratory chain.
									x	It possesses a succinate dehydrogenase gene cluster (SRU_0484-0487) very similar to Actinobacteria and a second succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit, sdhA (SRU_2444), most similar to sdhA2 from H. marismortui.
									x	Similarly, comparison of respiratory chain proteins in Salinibacter indicates there are two clusters of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and II genes, the first with coxA1 and coxB1 (SRU_2099 and SRU_2100) and the second with coxA2 and coxB2 (SRU_0314 and 0313).
									x	In support of this notion, a nosZDF gene cluster and an oxygen-sensitive Cpr/Fnr-type transcription regulator (20) are found near to coxA2 and coxB2 in Salinibacter. The nos cluster encodes a nitrous oxide reductase similar to that found in a variety of proteobacteria (21, 22) and in H. marismortui.
									x	Unlike haloarchaea but like R. marinus (23), it possesses components of a cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase (ccoO and ccoN) (SRU_0323 and SRU_0322).
									x	Strangely, Salinibacter does not possess a ccoP gene, thought to be an essential subunit of cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase (25).
									x	However, next to ccoON is a gene encoding a cytochrome c protein (SRU_0324), which also appears to have been transferred from a β-proteobacterium and may substitute for CcoP function in Salinibacter.
									x	The existence of multiple trkA genes in Salinibacter suggests complex regulation of the Trk system, a feature likely shared with haloarchaea. This complexity is increased by the presence of yet an additional TrkAH system in the hypersalinity island that is most similar to that found in Firmicutes
									x	Genes with significant similarity to the Salinibacter insAB have been found only in cyanobacteria, Parachlamydia, and members of two archaeal orders, Methanosarcinales and Sulfolobales.
									x	The possibility that Salinibacter might also have rhodopsin genes, derived from the haloarchaea with which it lives, was one of the initial motivations behind the present work. Indeed, like Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and Haloarcula marismortui, and unlike any other characterized bacterium, Salinibacter contains four rhodopsin genes (Fig. 4A).

Rhodopsins are highly diverse retinal-binding and photoactive membrane proteins [15], [16].
									x	This implies that rearrangements occur more frequently in the genomes of the Octadecabacter strains than in other Roseobacters.
									x	In the Octadecabacter genomes, a high mutagenicity is indicated by an unusually large number of pseudogenes (411 in O. arcticus and 361 in O. antarcticus; Table 2).
									x	An importance of mercury resistance in polar habitats is also indicated by the fact that the corresponding gene clusters are conserved in the Arctic and the Antarctic Octadecabacter strain but absent in many other Roseobacter clade members.

									x	For example, the D. gobiensis genome encodes a Deinococcus-specific global regulator (DGo_CA2805) that is similar to IrrE, a global regulator from the extremely radiation-resistant D. radiodurans that confers enhanced salt tolerance in both E. coli and in the plant Brassica napus
	26305944	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	Expanded metabolic versatility of ubiquitous nitrite-oxidizing bacteria from the genus Nitrospira.		y					Intriguingly, genes for urea utilization occur also in NOB other than N. moscoviensis. The recently sequenced draft genome of Nitrospira lenta, a strain which also belongs to Nitrospira lineage II (32), encodes a urea ABC transporter and the urease at a genomic locus that is mostly syntenic with the homologous region in N. moscoviensis 
									x	These sequences from soil and freshwater metagenomes (Fig. S3) suggest that Nitrospira with urease occur widespread in different terrestrial and aquatic habitats where urea is available (e.g., due to fertilization).
									x	The ureases of Nitrospira and Nitrospina are phylogenetically not closely related. The Nitrospina UreC sequences fall into a lineage of ureases from Proteobacteria (Fig. S3), indicating that the ureC gene was subject to lateral gene transfer.
									x	Aside from passive diffusion, the transport of urea into bacterial cells is mediated by urea-specific channels such as UreI of Helicobacter (53) or by ATP-dependent ABC transporters such as UrtABCDE in Cyanobacteria (54). ABC transporters for urea consist of a periplasmic substrate-binding protein (UrtA), a dimer of the transmembrane proteins UrtB and UrtC, which form a membrane-crossing pore, and the ATP-binding and -hydrolyzing proteins UrtD and UrtE (54, 55).
									x	Although UreE is required for a functional urease in Helicobacter (57), various other microorganisms lacking ureE genes express active ureases
									x	Interestingly, in Helicobacter pylori two accessory proteins of nickel-dependent hydrogenase, HypA and HypB, are required for the incorporation of Ni2+ into urease
									x	In contrast to most other aerobic bacteria, N. defluvii lacks SOD and catalase, and its genome does not code for superoxide reductase either

									x	Theba_1253, a divergent homolog of the other five genes in this family, is found in most Thermotogales genomes.
										The remaining three genes appear to have been acquired from different bacterial lineages: Theba_0936 clusters with Kosmotoga and Thermosipho within a Synergistetes clade, Theba_2070 is found in a clade containing Clostridia and Synergistetes, and Theba_0634 is found in a cluster containing a δ-proteobacterium and a Chloroflexi

It is a small region containing transposases as well as two homologs of a stability system StbDE (lpl1587, lpl1588). This island was originally associated with plasmids [25], but it has also been found on the chromosomes of other pathogenic bacteria [26].
	20219135	BMC genomics	Comparative genomics and proteomics of Helicobacter mustelae, an ulcerogenic and carcinogenic gastric pathogen.	https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-11-164	y				x	All of the gastric Helicobacter species produce a potent urease, as an acid protection mechanism, whereas the large number of enteric species (gastrointestinal, intestinal, hepatic and biliary) are not uniformly urease positive [7].
									x	The cag pathogenicity island of H. pylori is not present in H. mustelae, nor in any of the other helicobacters or campylobacters, including H. acinonychis which diverged relatively recently (ca. 200,00 years) from H. pylori
									x	The paucity of insertion sequence elements and bacteriophage-related genes in H. mustelae (Table 1) suggests that these mechanisms are not significant agents of diversity generation in this species, a process which is driven in H. pylori by free recombination [57]. Thus it was surprising to identify a CRISPR locus and three cas genes (HMU00230-00250) in the H. mustelae genome, as these features have recently been identified as a phage resistance mechanism [58]. CRISPR loci have not been annotated in other helicobacter or campylobacter genomes.
									x	HMU00170 Hag/Hly encodes a predicted 227 kDa protein with predicted signal peptide, and containing Pfam motifs for haemagglutination (Haemagg_act; PF05860), filamentous haemagglutinin (Fil_haemagg; PF05594), and an ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop). Homologues of this protein constitute a large family whose members are widely distributed among gram-negative pathogens, are annotated as either haemagglutinins or haemolysins, but which appear to lack functional characterization. The residue identity with HMU00170 is confined to the first 350 residues of that protein, and is particularly high over the filamentous haemagglutinin region (ca. 35-50% identity). Homologues of this pair of genes are lacking in helicobacters and campylobacters, suggesting this is an H. mustelae-specific acquisition among the ε-proteobacteria.
									x	Homologues of CiaB have been annotated in W. succinogenes and H. hepaticus, but not in H. pylori, which is curious because CiaB is also present in ε-proteobacteria isolated from sea vents
									x	HMU10120 is a homologue of proteins in other Campylobacterales which was first described in C. jejuni as PEB4a, and which is a major antigen and cell adhesin
									x	Relatively few longer stretches of the H. mustelae genome lack any significant homologues in H. pylori or H. hepaticu s; those that exist include HMU00600-HMU00690 that includes AT cluster 1; HMU01180-HMU01200 including AT cluster 2; and HMU10860-HMU10880 that encodes a predicted tricarboxylate transport system not found in the other Helicobacter species.
