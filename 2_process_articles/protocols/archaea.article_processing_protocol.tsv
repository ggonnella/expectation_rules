									Comparative genomic analyses of strain EN76T, ‘Candidatus Nitrosopumilus maritimus’ SCM1 (Walker et al., 2010) and ‘Candidatus Nitrososphaera gargensis’ Ga9.2 (Spang et al., 2012) revealed the presence of genes encoding transporters for amino acids, sulfonates (e.g. taurine) and glycerol in all three strains
						80%		x	Furthermore, the genome of EN76T carries genes for proteins belonging to the ferritin/Dps domain proteins (Nvie_002890, Nvie_017250, Nvie_020180, Nvie_028750, Nvie_029390), which have also been identified in genomes of other members of the  Thaumarchaeota

						90%		x	Nitrososphaeria: Cultivated strains within this class possess genes of both FtsZ- and Cdv-based cell division systems and have a topoisomerase IB. Similar to euryarchaeal strains, but in contrast to crenarchaeal strains, they have DNA polymerases B and D, eukaryote-like histones (H3/H4) and only one  copy of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen and lack genes for RNA polymerase G
						70%		x	Additionally, genes encoding an ammonia monooxygenase have been found exclusively in all lineages within the class, among all archaeal taxa described, and might therefore be considered a distinctive feature.
								x	So far, all investigated genomes of members of this class contain genes encoding key enzymes of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, suggesting that members of the phylum  Thaumarchaeota might assimilate their cellular carbon via a modified version of this pathway

One of them is DNA uptake protein DprA (TTX_0242), which is encoded in a predicted operon with another functionally related protein ComF (TTX_0243), which was never before detected in archaeal genomes and apparently has been transferred horizontally from Bacteria.
						70%		x	Genes encoding the stable RNA components of RNaseP or the signal recognition particle (7S RNA) are absent, like in most other Thermoproteaceae
									T. tenax has not lost any of the 234 arCOGs present in all Crenarchaeota, including nine that are not present in any euryarchaeal genomes. The latter set includes five genes that are shared with Eucarya: the recently described small RPB8 subunit of DNA-directed RNA polymerase (TTX_1930) [95], a Zn-finger containing protein, an apparent transcription elongation factor 1 ortholog (TTX_1715), and ribosomal proteins S25e, S26e and S30e (TTX_0177, TTX_0164, TTX_0151 and TTX_0161 (Table S7).
						90%			Complex I genes were found in many genomes of anaerobic Archaea including Archaeoglobus and also in several methanogens. Only 11 of the 14 subunits are conserved in most of the anaerobes, while the others are replaced by non-homologous ferredoxin or F420-oxidizing subunits.
						80%			A bona fide terminal oxidase was not identified in the T. tenax genome, however, two paralogous copies of the subunit I of a bd oxidase are present (cydA, TTX_0142 and TTX_0143). Many of the essential residues are conserved in TTX_0142 [64], [65], and therefore, the questions arise, whether this is indeed an oxygen-reducing enzyme and whether it is part of an oxygenic electron transport chain. Many anaerobic Archaea carry either this combination of terminal oxidase genes or alternatively, homologs of subunits I and II of these enzymes [64], [65].
						80%			The presence of multiple ferredoxin genes is characteristic for many Archaea.
									The presence of the three subunits for NADH binding and oxidation (Nqo1–3 or NuoEFG, NuoG gives ambiguous results) is so far rare for an anaerobic Archaeum.

It has two genes (Halxa_0209, Halxa_2361) belonging to the Capsular Polysaccharide Exporter family (TC 9.A.41). This is unusual as one of the members of this family is thought to transport polysaccharide across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria
								x	H. xanaduensis also has one gene (Halxa_2364) related to PseG, a UDP-sugar hydrolase involved in polysaccharide production [41]. The presence of these genes in H. xanaduensis suggests that it may be capable of extracellular polysaccharide synthesis using a process unlike any found in other haloarchaea.

								x	Haloarchaeal genomes are known to harbor inteins
								x	Most haloarchaeal genomes have a higher proportion guanine and cytosine bases that cause an increase in erroneous identification of start and stop codons for most gene calling algorithms
	25978546	The ISME journal	Elemental sulfur and acetate can support life of a novel strictly anaerobic haloarchaeon.	https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201579	Y			x	In addition to the membrane-bound succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II; HLASF_1576-1579) of the TCA cycle, the Complex I oxidoreductase provides another electron entry point in the HSR2 respiratory chain. Complex I genes were found in many genomes of anaerobic Archaea including Archaeoglobus, Thermoproteus and several methanogens. Only 11 of the 14 Complex I subunits are observed in most of these organisms (Siebers et al., 2011). Three other subunits, catalyzing NADH binding and oxidation in Complex I of aerobes, are replaced by nonhomologous ferredoxin- or F420-oxidizing subunits
								x	The HSR2 genome lacks genes encoding cytochrome c-oxidases found in aerobic prokaryotes and any atypical variants of cytochromes found in anaerobic bacteria.

								x	The species T. kodakarensis carries in its genome the stably integrated element TKV4 [45], which is closely related to pTN3 of T. nautili.
	27030530	Scientific reports	A novel ammonia-oxidizing archaeon from wastewater treatment plant: Its enrichment, physiological and genomic characteristics.	https://doi.org/10.1038/srep23747	Y			x	Using amoA as gene marker, recent investigations revealed that AOA occurred with great abundances in sites such as marine environment and acidic soils
								x	Urea was an alternative nitrogen and energy source for some AOA strains such as Nitrososphaera viennensis18, “Ca. Nitrososphaera gargensis”35 and “Ca. Cenarchaeum symbiosum”36, with urease and urea transporter gene identified in their genome (Supplementary Table S3).
								x	. Ectoine/hydroxyectoine were synthesized from L-aspartate-β-semialdehyde, with four enzymes (EctB, EctA, EctC and EctD) participating in that process (Supplementary Fig. S9a)46. Genes coding for these four enzymes were all found in the genome of Nitrosopumilus maritimus22 (Supplementary Table S3), which facilitated its adaptation to salinity higher than 3.5%, but absent from the genome of the SAT1.
								x	Mannosylglycerate could be used for high osmosis and heat stress protection, and it is synthesized from 3-phosphoglycerate and GDP- mannose via a two-step pathway (Supplementary Fig. S9b)47. Two genes responsible for this pathway were identified in “Ca. Nitrososphaera gargensis” and “Ca. Nitrososphaera evergladensis”19,35, but not in the genome of the SAT1.
								x	When cells were in hypo-osmosis environment, the MscL channel could pump hydrated solutes, e.g. potassium, out of the cell. This caused a rapid decrease in cytoplasmic hydrated solutes concentrations, lowered the osmotic driving force for water entry, and protected the cells against lysis49. This channel was present in the genomes of a nearby low-salinity adapted AOA “Ca. Nitrosotenuis uzonensis” and another low salinity strain “Ca. Nitrosoarchaeum limnia” SFB117, but absent from the genome of Nitrosopumilus spp. strain, which lived mainly in high-salinity marine environment22,33,50.
								x	Several surveys had demonstrated that Group I.1b (mainly wastewater cluster D) AOA were the most dominant in WWTPs, then was WWC-B within Group I.1a, but Nitrosopumilus spp. AOA were rarely found7,10,13. Taking genomic properties into consideration, the former two clusters all contained genes coding for flagella and pili17,19,26,35, while Nitrosopumilus spp. AOAs were lack of them22,33,50.

Serena	29945179	FEMS Microbiology reviews	Biotechnology of extremely thermophilic archaea	https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/42/5/543/5045018	Y			x	The first confirmed archaeal sulfate reducers were in the hyperthermophilic genus Archaeoglobus (Topt = 85°C) (Stetter et al.1987), which share gene homologs for sulfate adenyltransferase (Sat), adenylyl sulfate reductase (AprAB) and sulfite reductase (DsrABD) with bacteria (Klenk et al.1997); recent genome sequence data suggest that the archaeon T tenax has also the requisite genes for sulfate reduction (Siebers et al.2011).
								x	Most extremely thermophilic archaea have a modified Embden-Meyerhof central glycolysis pathway which converts glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) in a single step via a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase. This bypasses two steps normally found in E-M glycolysis, the reduction of GAP via glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ATP production via phosphoglycerate kinase. Thus, the pathway from glucose to pyruvate is a net zero ATP process when considering only substrate phosphorylation.
								x	Hydrogenases, which catalyze the reversible reaction between protons, an electron source and hydrogen, can be classified into three types based on the metal content in the catalytic site: [NiFe], [FeFe] and mononuclear Fe hydrogenases but, for reasons that are not clear, the [FeFe]-enzymes have yet to be found in any of the archaea
								x	The NiFe-enzymes are ubiquitous and the extremely thermophilic archaeon P. furiosus possesses three such enzymes. One is membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH) and two are in the cytoplasm (SHI and SHII).
								x	Most members of the Thermococcales contain genes encoding at least one MBH and one SH (Schut et al.2013).
								x	Three fhl operons were identified in the genome of T. onnurineus, with the fhl2 operon being essential for growth with formate as the energy source (Kim et al.2010).
								x	While there are no known archaea utilizing the CBB cycle, type III Rubisco enzymes are found exclusively in archaea, possibly hinting at the evolutionary heritage of this important protein
								x	All methane-generating organisms, including those responsible for methane generation in the human gut, are archaea.
								x	The first confirmed archaeal sulfate reducers were in the hyperthermophilic genus Archaeoglobus (Topt = 85°C) (Stetter et al.1987), which share gene homologs for sulfate adenyltransferase (Sat), adenylyl sulfate reductase (AprAB) and sulfite reductase (DsrABD) with bacteria
								x	A new type of oxidative stress was discovered in P. furiosus, which was subsequently found in virtually all anaerobes, involving the enzyme superoxide reductase (SOR) (Jenney et al.1999).

									For example, a high-affinity phosphate uptake operon found in the genome of “Ca. Nitrosopumilus maritimus” was not detected in the AR1 genome.
Serena	20421470	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	Nitrosopumilus maritimus genome reveals unique mechanisms for nitrification and autotrophy in globally distributed marine crenarchaea	https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0913533107?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed	Y				The third 2dMCO (Nmar_1354), possessing a fused blue copper-containing domain, has not been found in AOB and appears to be unique to AOA.
								x	However, whereas AOB use the Calvin–Bassham–Benson cycle with the CO2-fixing enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) as the key enzyme, the absence of genes in N. maritimus coding for RubisCO and other enzymes of this cycle points to an alternative pathway for carbon fixation
								x	The most likely mechanism supported by the genome sequence is the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway elucidated in the thermophilic crenarchaote Metallosphaera sedula and suggested as a potential pathway of carbon fixation in C. symbiosum
								x	The pathway has two parts: a sequence including two carboxylation reactions transforming acetyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA and a multistep sequence converting succinyl-CoA into two molecules of acetyl-CoA. Genes identified in the N. maritimus genome coding for key enzymes of the pathway (Fig. S3) include a biotin-dependent acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase (Nmar_0272–0274), methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase and mutase (Nmar_0953, _0954, and _0958), and 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydratase (Nmar_0207). With the exception of one gene (Nmar_1608), all of the genes implicated in the 3-hydroxyproprionate/4-hydrobutyrate pathway for carbon assimilation in N. maritimus are present and show highest similarity to the genes of C. symbiosum
								x	Similarly, M. sedula catalyzes the activation of 3-hydroxypropionate to 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA, using an AMP-forming 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthetase (37). The N. maritimus genome lacks an obvious homolog, although does code for an ADP-forming acyl-CoA synthetase (Nmar_1309) that suggests a more energy efficient alternative.
								x	In addition to the genes coding for the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway, the genome of N. maritimus contains a number of genes encoding enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. No homologs for genes coding for a citrate-cleaving enzyme (ATP citrate lyase or citryl-CoA lyase) (38) were identified, permitting exclusion of the reductive TCA cycle as a pathway for carbon fixation.
								x	No genomic evidence exists for growth on urea, as N. maritimus lacks the homologs of the putative urease and urea transporter genes identified in C. symbiosum (35).
								x	All other sequenced crenarchaea (including C. symbiosum) contain at least 46 tRNAs. N. maritimus lacks tRNA sequences coding for ProCGG or ArgCCG, perhaps resulting from (or related to) the low G + C content of the genome and preference for protein codons ending in A/T.
								x	Other archaeal genomes with relatively low G + C content, such as the euryarchaeon Haloquadratum walsbyi, also lack these tRNAs, while possessing the exact complement of 44 tRNAs found in N. maritimus
								x	The genome contains at least eight transcription factor B (TFB) and two TATA-box binding protein (TBP) (Table S3) genes required for starting site-specific transcription initiation, making N. maritimus among the densest and richest archaeal genomes for these transcription factors.
								x	Although many other archaeal genomes contain multiple copies of these transcription factors, only the haloarchaea have more than five TFB genes
								x	The N. maritimus genome contains elements homologous with two systems of cell division: ftsZ (Nmar_1262) and cdvABC (Nmar_0700, _0816, and _1088). The cdvABC operon, induced at the onset of genome segregation and cell division, codes for machinery related to the eukaryotic endosomal sorting complex (49, 50). With the exception of N. maritimus, C. symbiosum, and the Thermoproteales (where the cell division machinery remains uncharacterized), all available archaeal genomes have either the FtsZ or the Cdv cell division machinery, but not both.
								x	The genome of N. maritimus also encodes for synthesis of the compatible solute hydroxyectoine: ectoine synthase (ectC, Nmar_1344), a L-2,4-diaminobutyrate transaminase (ectB, Nmar_1345), a L-2,4-diaminobutyrate acetyltransferase (ectA, Nmar_1346), and an ectoine hydroxylase (ectD, Nmar_1343).

								x	With the exception of N. pharaonis, all of the species carried the phaE and phaC genes, which all were located adjacent to the phaP-homologous genes.
								x	Interestingly, a similar gene cluster composed of maoC-gap12-phaP-phaE-phaC was present in 7 of the 10 species, with the exception of H. utahensis, H. borinquense, and H. jeotgali, which harbored a PGAP gene cluster lacking the maoC gene.
								x	Notably, although many proteins are characterized as phasins in bacteria, including PhaP/PhaP1, PhaP2, PhaP3, PhaP4, PhaF, PhaI, the newly identified PhaP5 (25), and phasin-like PhaM (26), the homologous PhaP proteins of H. mediterranei (PhaPhme) only exist in haloarchaea

For example, environmental isolates of Pyrococcus differ in their distribution of IS elements, suggesting a high degree of mobility (58), as has been reported for other hyperthermophilic archaea from freshwater vents
								x	The availability of a highly efficient genetically tractable strain of P. furiosus (COM1) has dramatically expanded the potential to study this model hyperthermophilic species. Its sequence not only defines the genetic platform for these future studies but has also provided novel insights into the biology of this organism, including the dynamic nature of its genome and the utility of two classical carbohydrate metabolism genes, gapn and celB.
								x	Among the seven IS annotated archaeal genomes (30), P. furiosus harbors far more IS elements (29 full, 6 partial) than does any other member of the Thermococcales but less than a quarter of the IS elements identified in the Sulfolobus solfataricus genome (146 full, 297 partial).
								x	In fact, no full-length IS elements have been identified in the genomes of Pyrococcus abyssi or Pyrococcus horikoshii, and only one full-length IS element has been identified in T. kodakarensis (30).
								x	GAPN has been shown to be a key glycolytic enzyme in the related euryarchaeon T. kodakarensis, since a strain with a targeted gene knockout (ΔgapN) was unable to grow on malto-oligosaccharides (41). Similarly, GAPN plays a key glycolytic role in various crenarchaeota, including Thermoproteus (5), Aeropyrum (47) and Sulfolobus (1, 17) species.
								x	COM1 also lacks the gene encoding CelB, which has been shown to be the cellobiose-hydrolyzing enzyme in P. furiosus that constitutes up to 5% of the total cell protein during growth on this β-1,4-linked disaccharide (29).
								x	In P. furiosus, Cas6 has been shown to recognize and cleave foreign RNA that matches spacer sequences present in the host's CRISPR loci (6, 21).

In particular, H. mediterranei is capable of accumulating poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) from many cheap carbon sources (12, 17, 18). Two key enzymes (PhaEC and PhaB) and a structure protein (PhaP) involved in PHBV biosynthesis have been identified in H. mediterranei

The conserved respiration system is also represented by membrane-bound hydrogenase and A0A1-type ATP synthase
								x	Different with Pyrococcus species, Pa. pacificus does not contain “saccharolytic gene island” and “maltose and trehalose degradation gene” (5), which carries a set of genes responsible for the utilization of cellulose, laminarin, agar, maltose, trehalose, and other β-linked polysaccharides. These genes are also absent in Thermococcus species except Thermococcus sibiricus (5).
								x	Analysis of the repeated sequences and a search against the IS database revealed that a remarkable feature of the Pa. pacificus genome is the absence of mobile genetic elements including transposons, transposases, integrases and virus-related region. It indicates that Pa. pacificus genome has not been subjected to frequent or recent genomic rearrangements during its evolution.

	32759215	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	Symbiosis between nanohaloarchaeon and haloarchaeon is based on utilization of different polysaccharides.	https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2007232117?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed	Y			x	The ectosymbiont lacks genes for xenorhodopsin biosynthesis, which occurs in some nanohaloarchaeal MAGs (18).
								x	In agreement with this, several sequences related to the diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) locus were found in the LC1Nh genome (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 and Text). This versatile tool for protein diversification that might be involved in mediating the interaction between ectosymbiont and host seems to be prevalent in several DPANN lineages, but has not been reported in Nanohaloarchaeota previously.
								x	To start with, Ca. Nanohaloarchaeum antarcticus possesses unusually large SPEARE proteins which are likely involved in attachment to a host. Although homologs of these genes are found in many nanohaloarchaeal genomes, they are absent in Ca. Nanohalobium. Conversely, Ca. Nanohalobium does possess its diversity-generating retroelements locus, which is not seen in other nanohaloarchaeal genomes.
								x	Another feature common to all nanohaloarchaea with reconstructed genomes is the presence of organism-specific lectin-like proteins containing one or more of the laminin globular- or Con A-like domains.

								x	Like all known hyperthermophiles, reverse gyrase is present.
								x	Ca. K. cryptofilum possesses a full complement of archaeal DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) subunits. The rpoA and rpoB genes encoding the largest subunits of the RNAP are intact. In addition to the typical archaeal RNAP subunits, a coding region of 110 aa was identified with limited sequence similarity to the RPB8 subunit of the eukaryotic RNAP. Subsequent in-depth analysis has shown that an ortholog of RPB8, previously thought to be missing in archaea, is also encoded by all sequenced genomes of hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeota
								x	Notably, r-proteins S30e, S25e, S26e, and L13e that are conserved in the Crenarchaeota but are absent in Euryarchaeota (33) were identified.
								x	For example, a type II DNA polymerase and a divergent ftsZ homologue are present in Cenarchaeum symbiosum (48), and histones are also found in mesophilic and some hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeota (49, 50).
	24999826	PloS one	Genome sequence of Candidatus Nitrososphaera evergladensis from group I.1b enriched from Everglades soil reveals novel genomic features of the ammonia-oxidizing archaea.	https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101648	Y			x	For example, the genome size of Ca. Nitrososphaera gargensis is much bigger than other sequenced genomes from group I.1a. Additionally, the sequence analysis indicated higher G+C content, more thermosome genes, and a different chemical structure of membrane lipids
								x	Ca. N. evergladensis, much like all known chemolithotrophic AOA, is predicted to fix inorganic carbon via a modified 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle
								x	Unusual enzymes for glycolysis were found in the genome of Ca. N. evergladensis such as multiple kinases (NTE_03124, NTE_00636, NTE_01922) from the ribokinase superfamily that have broad substrate specificity (e. g. glucose, fructose and mannose) and can be candidates for hexokinase and phosphofructokinase enzymes for glycolytic pathway in AOA.
								x	The isomerization of glucose-6P/fructose-6P in Nitrososphaera may be catalyzed by either metal-dependent phosphoglucose isomerase (NTE_01540), which belongs to the cupin superfamily and found in the Euryarchaeota or with bifunctional phosphoglucose/phosphomannose isomerase from the sugar isomerases family (NTE_02296). 
								x	A homolog of pyruvate dikinase was detected in the genome (NTE_02861). Pyruvate dikinase catalyzes reversible interconversion of PEP and pyruvate in Thermopreotei
								x	All enzyme homologs of the non-oxidative phase of the hexose monophosphate pathway were identified in Ca. N. evergladensis except 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is missing. This enzyme is one of the key enzymes of the oxidative phase (Figure S6 in File S1, Table S1 in File S2). This enzyme was found in the genome of Ca. N. gargensis but not in other Thaumarchaeota
								x	F420-dependent oxidoreductase, G6PDH family has been found in archaeal methanogens, Streptomyces, and Mycobacteria [38], [39].
								x	Similar to other AOA, Ca. N. evergladensis does not use the Entner-Doudoroff pathway [3].
								x	However, the majority of sequenced AOA from the group I.1a (N. maritimus, Ca. N. limnia, Ca. N. salaria, Ca. N. koreensis, Ca. N. uzonensis) do not have any signatures of urea degradation
								x	Similar to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), archaea of group I.1b encode several amoC subunits of AMO [42]. However, majority representatives of group I.1.a have only one copy of amoC
								x	It is noteworthy that multiple copies of amoC appear more often in AOA and AOB associated with soil environments, which harbor more diverse stressors than marine environments and require more adaptations for organisms to survive and successfully compete [42]. For example, ammonia oxidizers from soil have up to seven amoC copies (Figure S7 in File S1), while marine AOA and AOB usually encode only one amoC
								x	Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase was found almost in all representatives of Thaumarchaeota
								x	Mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate and myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthases were found in the genomes of group I.1b but not in the genomes of group I.1a.
								x	A higher tolerance of AOA than AOB to copper was shown in soil [61]. Ettema et al. (2006) [62] suggested a potential copper resistance gene cluster, which consists of a putative methallochaperone and P-type cation transporting ATPase. This mechanism was identified in thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus metallicus, Sulfolobus solfataricus, and Ferroplasma acidarmanus
								x	A similar gene cluster with encoded P-type ATPases and copper chaperones was found in Ca. N. evergladensis (Table S1 in File S2). This mechanism of copper tolerance was also present in Ca. N. gargensis genome but not in other sequenced AOA.
								x	Multiple putative multicopper oxidases are encoded in all known AOA, however, their role in copper tolerance remains unclear
								x	Periplasmic divalent cation tolerance protein (NTE_02314) is widely represented in AOA, and may also transport copper outside the cell.
								x	Ca. N. evergladensis has three putative nickel transporter genes, and one of these high affinity permeases (NTE_02909) is specific only for this thaumarchaeon.
								x	Notably, an arsenic pump was identified only in the genomes of Nitrososphaera species but not in AOA related to Nitrosopumilus.
								x	Glutamate synthase (NTE_01407) was found only in the Ca. N. evergladensis genome, and not other sequenced AOA genomes.
								x	The response regulator of the TS ComP/ComA, which controls competence in Bacillus subtilis via a quorum-sensing mechanism [79], was also found in the group I.1b, but not in the group I.1a.
								x	One of the specific signatures of the known Thaumarchaeota is that their genomes, including Ca. N. evergladensis, are missing gene homologs for r-protein family LXa that is solely present in Archaea.
								x	Also, r-proteins L14e and L34e found in other archaeal phyla but not in Thaumarchaeota, are missing from Ca. N. evergladensis.
								x	However, in contrast to Euryarchaeota, Crenarchaeota and Nanoarchaeota that have two genes encoding A subunit of RNAP, Ca. N. evergladensis and other Thaumarchaeota contain a single rpoA gene. This unsplit rpoA is common for Eykarya and it was suggested that other archaeal lineages that possess split rpoA branched off later in evolution than the Thaumarchaeota [52].
								x	The gene encoding topoisomerase IB, a signature marker for Thaumarchaeota, but not for other archaeal phyla, is present in the Ca. N. evergladensis genome.
								x	Similar to other Thaumarchaeota, Ca. N. evergladensis possesses the genes needed to compress and methylate DNA. The DNA repair system of Ca. N. evergladensis includes UvrABC endonuclease, which is common in mesophilic archaea
								x	For example, sequenced AOA representatives from the group I.1b have a larger genome size and higher G+C content than the archaea from the group I.1a.
								x	Also, unlike the I.1a group, the I.1b group seems to be capable of utilizing complex carbohydrates such as glycogen, chitin, and triacylglycerides, as suggested by the presence of genes coding for the glycogen debranching enzyme (NTE_01977), multiple chitin deacetylases, gene homologs for chitinases (NTE_00025, NTE_01408), and monoglyceride lipases.
	28077874	nature	Asgard archaea illuminate the origin of eukaryotic cellular complexity	https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0qh5400s				x	Next, to gain further insight into the emergence of eukaryotic gene content,we identified potential eukaryotic signature proteins (ESPs) in the reconstructed Asgard genomes. Notably, all Asgard lineages were found to be enriched for such ESPs, suggesting that these are widespread across the Asgard superphylum
								x	ESPs identified in the new Asgard genomes previously identified in the composite Lokiarchaeum genome11,14 included an expanded set of the composite Lokiarchaeum genome11,14 included an expanded set of GTPases (Extended Data Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 8), eukaryotic RLC7 family proteins (Supplementary Fig. 1), actin homologues (Supplementary Fig. 2), gelsolin-domain proteins, components of eukaryotic ESCRT (I, II and III) systems including two sub-families of SNF7 proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3), ubiquitin modifier system components (Supplementary Fig. 4) and homologues of eukaryotic protein translocation and glycosylation pathways (Extended Data Table 2, Extended Data Fig. 4).
								x	Phylogenetic analyses of the thorarchaeal TRAPP domain proteins revealed that they form a monophyletic group with eukaryotic TRAPPC3 (Bet3 family), TRAPPC5 and TRAPPC6 family proteins.
								x	In addition, thorarchaeal genomes encode homologues of eukaryotic Sec23/24 family proteins, which are essential components of COPII, a protein complex responsible for vesicle-mediated ER-to-Golgi transport of protein cargo32. Protein domain and structure prediction analysis of these thorarchaeal Sec23/24 homologues indicate that they contain the zinc-finger, trunk and β-sandwich domains of eukaryotic Sec23/24 family proteins, but lack the C-terminal helical and gelsolin domains
								x	The present identification of Sec23/24 domain proteins in all our thorarchaeal genome bins, in addition to the presence of longin domain proteins in Lokiarchaeota11,14 as well as in Heimdall- and Odinarchaeota (Extended Data Table 2, Fig. 1d) prompted us to search for potential coatomer proteins.
								x	While proteins containing either β-propeller or α-solenoid folds are widespread among prokaryotes34, including all Asgard lineages (Supplementary Table 10 and 11), proteins containing both folds are extremely rare outside the eukaryotic domain
								x	Notably, thorarchaeal genomes encode several homologues of eukaryotic membrane-trafficking machinery components, including Sec23/24 and TRAPP domains.
