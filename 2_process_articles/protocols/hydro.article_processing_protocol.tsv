					only mentions one endosymbiont species association, maybe information too specific		Recent molecular and isotopic data indicate that the epsilon proteobacterial community associated with Alvinella pompejana, which thrives on the sides of the hotter black smoker chimneys at deep-sea hydrothermal vents, may utilize the rTCA cycle for autotrophic growth. Two of the key genes were present and expressed in the episymbiont community, which is dominated by members of the epsilon subdivision of Proteobacteria (7).
						x	Expression analysis, as well as the overwhelming presence and phylogenetic diversity of rTCA genes, indicate that the principal pathway utilized in hydrothermal vent free-living microbial communities is the rTCA cycle. Phylogenetic analysis of the key rTCA genes indicates that the majority group with known epsilon proteobacterial sequences.
						x	Although the Calvin cycle is widely distributed (14, 45), our molecular evidence suggests it is less prevalent in the hydrothermal vent samples we analyzed. This study provides evolutionary insight for the hypothesis that a version of the rTCA cycle was the first autotrophic pathway to have evolved (51) and demonstrates that it is an important carbon fixation pathway in deep-sea hydrothermal vents and potentially in other environments, such as the deep subsurface.
					the group organisms cannot be assertained		The presence and expression of porA genes that are not related to the known epsilon proteobacterial sequences and that group with known archaeal sequences in some cases suggests the potential use of the acetyl-CoA pathway by free-living microorganisms at deep-sea hydrothermal vents.
							We found that all 12 chimney samples contained the required rTCA genes aclB and nifJ and 10 of 12 were positive for the rTCA genes porA and oorA.

						x	The pentose phosphate pathway (oxidative branch) is known to be the major pathway for NADPH production and well conserved in the genomes of sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria, but the genomes of several, such as Calyptogena endosymbionts, Alkalilimnicola ehrlichei, Thioalkalivibrio strain K90mix and Halorhodospira halophila, do not possess the branch.
							In contrast, the portion of the TCA cycle contributing NADPH production is conserved in all the genomic sequences in chemolithoautotrophic Gammaproteobacteria that grow with carbon fixation through the CBB pathway.
						x	Genes for an incomplete-type Sox system and a nearly complete Dsr system for oxidation of sulfur compounds such as sulfide, elemental sulfur, thiosulfate and sulfite, are present in the genome, as is the case for several sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria (Figure 4). Among the genes for periplasmic Sox-type sulfur oxidation system, genes for SoxBZYKAX are encoded in a gene cluster, but the genes for SoxCD and their homologues SorAB are missing, as is the case of the incomplete SOX system in other sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria.

The grouping of archaeal amoA in the present study was based on previous studies (2, 10, 41). The most abundant phylogroup was the Ba subgroup, with subgroups A and D as predominant populations. Coordination between the thaumarchaeal SSU rRNA and amoA gene clusters was suggested as follows: group α in the SSU rRNA gene and D in amoA, β and A, γ and Ba, and δ and Ba (41). Thus, the predominance of group D was expected in the archaeal amoA gene communities based on the SSU rRNA gene clone analysis, while it was not the most abundant population in the amoA clone analysis. A similar contradiction between the SSU rRNA and amoA gene clone analyses was also observed in a previous water column study on the Mariana Trench, and the contradiction was suggested to be a result of biases in the amoA gene clone analysis (41).
							Archaeal SSU rRNA gene clone libraries were dominated by only one phylotype MCD_AB10_5cm_A01, which belonged to the α subgroup of the Marine Group I (MGI) Thaumarchaeota, including the genus Nitrosopumilus. MCD_AB10_5cm_A01 was very similar to the hadal water phylotype MW_10000m_04 (similarity >98%).

This sulfur-oxidizing capacity was shared among the SUP05 endosymbionts (EBS, CRM, and CVO).
							However, genes for alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases involved in the interconversion of succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) and 2-oxoglutarate were not detected, indicating that VS-SUP05 may be an obligate chemolithoautotroph in the SUP05 clade (1, 21).
							For example, the missing genes for the biosynthesis of proline and tyrosine could be found in the other bacterial genomes in the sponge-associated microbiota.
							However, Slaby et al. (35) revealed that sponge-associated bacteria from Aplysina aerophoba in the Mediterranean Sea (5-m depth) have more genes related to bacterial defense, such as toxin-antitoxin systems, than the reference bacteria including free-living bacteria. This indicates contrasting chemical environments in symbiotic systems of different sponge species and/or different habitats (such as shallow sea versus deep sea).

30768760	Environ Microbiol Rep	Deep-sea hydrothermal vent metagenome-assembled genomes provide insight into the phylum Nanoarchaeota	https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-2229.12740	N		x	The small genomes of cultivated Nanoarchaeota lack nearly all biosynthetic pathways and have split protein-coding genes (Waters et al., 2003; Wurch et al., 2016; St. John et al., 2019), pointing to a common pattern of genomic reduction and fragmentation.
					Look into the citations further, Nanoarchaeum equitans does not carry the gene atpB, but contains the gene atpA; "A rather interesting organism is Nanoarchaeum equitans whose genome has been sequenced (see above). On its chromosome, only the gene encoding subunit A could be identified, the gene annotated as atpB is too small to encode a functional B subunit. In this case, atpB is apparently absent since it should be easily detectable by BLAST searches due to the high sequence conservation of this major subunits. "---- found in Uniprot that atpB was identified in one Nanoarchaeon genome, might have neen a recent find		No functional ATP synthase has been identified in any nanoarchaeotal genome, and no complete pathway for ATP production through substrate-level phosphorylation has been discovered (Podar et al., 2013; Mohanty et al., 2015; Wurch et al., 2016; Jarett et al., 2018; St. John et al., 2019), leaving it unclear how nanoarchaeotes obtain energy to fuel metabolic processes.
							Similar to described Nanoarchaeota, the MAGs contain several split protein-coding genes (Table 1), which are separated into multiple coding regions and often widely separated across the genome. Each MAG encodes a split gene for the large helicase-related protein, which is split in all cultivated Nanoarchaeota genomes (Waters et al., 2003; Wurch et al., 2016; St. John et al., 2019).
							Like other described Nanoarchaeota, the three deep-sea MAGs retain very few genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotides and cofactors (Fig. 2A and B). The major loss of biosynthetic genes has also been predicted for other putatively host-dependent Archaea in the DPANN superphylum, including Candidatus Pacearchaeota and some members of the Candidatus Woesearchaeota (Castelle et al., 2018).
						x	Unlike cultivated Nanoarchaeota, however, the Gua-46 MAG contains a predicted tyrosine-specific transporter (Gua_114), which may allow the nanoarchaeote to uptake this amino acid from the environment. The MC-1 MAG also encodes for genes involved in nucleotide biotransformation that have not been previously identified in cultivated nanoarchaeotes, including a cytidylate kinase (MC-1_488) and a uridylate kinase (MC-1_320).
							In contrast to their extensive loss of biosynthetic functionality, all cultivated Nanoarchaeota genomes retain a common set of protein coding genes, predominantly involved in DNA repair and replication, ribosomal structure, transcription, translation and post-translational modification (arCOG clusters J, K, L and O; Supporting Information Tables S6–S9 and Text S1).
							However, instead of utilizing a sulfide: quinone oxidoreductase, these Nanoarchaeota could potentially use a cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase (Fig. 2B), fueled by quinols from the host (Jarett et al., 2018). Although cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase could contribute to the generation of a membrane potential (Borisov et al., 2011), it is unclear what role this enzyme would play in nanoarchaeotal bioenergetics, since no ATP synthase has been identified in any terrestrial Nanoarchaeota genome to date (Podar et al., 2013; Wurch et al., 2016; St. John et al., 2019).
						x	The MAGs also contain a mosaic of key nanoarchaeotal features, including CRISPR repeat regions and marker genes for gluconeogenesis and archaeal flagella.
						x	However, MC-1 does encode genes involved in the pentose bisphosphate pathway, previously described in Thermococcus kodakarensis (Fig. 4), which would allow nanoarchaeotal cells to produce 3-phosphoglycerate and bypass the missing steps in glycolysis (Aono et al., 2012; 2015). The pentose bisphosphate pathway typically begins with nucleoside monophosphates, which may be produced by a putative nucleoside kinase (MC_288) that shows 35.1%–37.4% amino acid similarity to nucleoside kinases in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Aeropyrum pernix (Hansen et al., 2007; Aono et al., 2015).

26371554	Elife	Abundant toxin-related genes in the genomes of beneficial symbionts from deep-sea hydrothermal vent mussels	https://elifesciences.org/articles/07966		quite group-specific		Between 2.3 and 7.6% of the genes found only in the Bathymodiolus SOX symbionts but not in the clam symbionts and SUP05, genomes were annotated as toxin or virulence genes (Figure 2). Most were related to genes from one of three toxin classes: (1) the RTX (repeats in toxins) toxins, (2) MARTX (multifunctional autoprocessing RTX toxins), a sub-group of RTX toxins, and (3) YD repeat toxins (also called rhs genes as they were initially described as ‘recombination hotspots’).
						x	While MARTX genes were enriched in host-associated bacteria regardless of their location, YD repeat genes were only significantly enriched in intracellular bacteria. In contrast to YD repeat and MARTX genes, RTX did not show any enrichment in the three defined categories. RTX are therefore widely distributed among bacteria and are just as likely to be found in free-living and host-associated bacteria
					quite group-specific		Two scenarios could explain the origin of the large complement of TRGs in the Bathymodiolus symbionts and not in their close relatives: firstly, the TRGs could have been in the genome of their last common ancestor but were all subsequently lost in both the clam symbionts and SUP05.
						x	The symbionts encode a modified version of the Calvin cycle that lacks the enzyme sedoheptulose-1,7-biphosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Instead, the symbionts have a pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) as described in other chemosynthetic symbioses
					quite group-specific		To acquire the necessary energy to fuel carbon fixation, the Bathymodiolus symbionts can utilize reduced sulfur compounds and hydrogen (Petersen et al., 2011; Kleiner et al., 2012a). The pathways for sulfur oxidation present in the genomes are similar to those of other SOX symbionts of R. pachyptila tubeworms, or vesicomyid and solemyid clam symbionts (Figure 2—figure supplement 3) (Robidart et al., 2008; Harada et al., 2009; Kleiner et al., 2012a; Dmytrenko et al., 2014). We found the genes that encode SoxABXYZ and sulfide-quinone reductases (Sqr), which reduce cytochrome c and quinones using sulfide and/or thiosulfate as electron donor.
						x	RTX genes were not preferentially found in host-associated bacteria but were also regularly found in free-living bacteria. Bloom-forming aquatic cyanobacteria had some of the highest numbers of RTX genes (Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 3).
						x	Members of the marine Roseobacter clade also had an unusually large number of RTX genes (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). Roseobacter are some of the most abundant bacteria in marine habitats.
							In fact, the combination of hemagglutinin, pectin lyase, and CPD domains has so far only been found in the filamentous hemagglutinin protein of the betaproteobacterial pathogens B. pertussis and B. bronchiseptica, which is a key determinant of epithelial cell attachment and immune response modulation in Bordetella infections (Melvin et al., 2014).

							A relatively higher abundance of cobalt−zinc−cadmium resistance genes and virulence genes (e.g. phage integration and excision genes) were found in the deep-sea vents (H1, H2) than in the shallow-sea vent (G1)
					this article only analyzed the sampling sites of a specific vent: conclusions were made but unsure whether this applies also in other similar environments such as other vents		In addition, greater abundance of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (COG1866, COG2352) was found in the shallow-sea vent than in the deep-sea vent (Figure 6).
							Transporter for Fe3+ (COG1629, COG0609) genes were enriched in the H1 dataset, whereas Fe2+ transporter genes (COG0370) were identified in all datasets (Figure 6).
							However, special functional categories, such as transposase and carbon fixation, were found in several datasets. This result indicated that a core of genes was shared by the vent-associated bacterial community.
							Genes encoding the key enzyme for rTCA cycle-pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (COG0674, COG1013) were more abundant in the shallow-sea vent than in the deep-sea vent (Figure 6), reflecting a possible adaptation of the organisms to the high CO2 present within the shallow-sea hydrothermal system.
							In addition, greater abundance of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (COG1866, COG2352) was found in the shallow-sea vent than in the deep-sea vent (Figure 6). These enzymes elicit anaplerotic activities by replenishing oxaloacetate to the rTCA/TCA cycle [38].
25124552	BMC Genomics	Comparative genomics highlights the unique biology of Methanomassiliicoccales, a Thermoplasmatales-related seventh order of methanogenic archaea that encodes pyrrolysine	https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-679		Y	x	Comparative analyses revealed atypical features, such as the scattering of the ribosomal RNA genes in the genome and the absence of eukaryotic-like histone gene otherwise present in most of Euryarchaeota genomes. Previously identified in Thermoplasmatales genomes, these features are presently extended to several completely sequenced genomes of this large evolutionary branch, including MG-II and DHVE2.
							All the necessary genetic machinery is found in the three genomes of the Methanomassiliicoccales, including the genes for pyrrolysine synthesis (pylBCD), the amber suppressor tRNAPyl (pylT) and the dedicated amino-acyl tRNA synthetase (pylS).
						x	In particular, the analysis of “Ca. M. alvus” and M. luminyensis methanogenic pathways revealed they lack the 6 step C1-pathway forming methyl-CoM by the reduction of CO2 with H2, otherwise present in all previously sequenced methanogens, fitting with their restriction to H2-dependent methylotrophic methanogenesis [16].
							As previously described [25], an important feature is the presence of a tRNAPyl in all the three genomes.
						x	Strikingly, 16S and 23S rRNA genes are not clustered and do not form a transcriptional unit as found in most bacterial and archaeal genomes. Among archaea, this unusual characteristic was first documented in Thermoplasmatales [27], but is also found in related lineages such as the uncultured Marine Group II (MG-II) and Aciduliprofundum boonei(Figure 1).
						x	The Methanomassiliicoccales, Marine Group II, and DHVE2 harbor both subunits of the archaeal topoisomerase TopoVI, strengthening a specific loss of this gene in Thermoplasmatales, which replaced it by a bacterial-type DNA gyrase [42]. Moreover, all three Methanomassiliicoccales representatives also harbor a bacterial-like DNA gyrase, known to have been acquired from bacteria in late emerging Euryarchaeota [41].
						x	An important feature shared by the three Methanomassiliicoccales representatives, the Thermoplasmatales and other related lineages is the lack of Eukaryotic-like histone found in other Euryarchaeota [43], suggesting that the loss of this gene occurred early in the evolution of the whole lineage. Surprisingly, no gene coding for homologues of the bacterial-type HTa histones known to have replaced the native histone in Thermoplasmatales and DHVE2 are present in the Methanomassiliicoccales genomes and the MG-II genome.
						x	As usually observed in methanogens, the three species harbors an incomplete reductive TCA cycle [46].
						x	Similarly to other methanogens and differently from the Thermoplasmatales representatives, the three Methanomassiliicoccales lack PurK for purine synthesis pathway.
							Each Methanomassiliicoccales genome encodes at least one catalase (katE), peroxiredoxin (prx), rubredoxin (rub) and rubrerythrin (rbr) to resist to oxygen exposure (Additional file 1: Table S9). M
						x	Another adaptation to GIT could be inferred through the presence of a conserved amino acid domain corresponding to COG0790 (TPR repeat, SEL1 subfamily) in at least one protein of each Methanomassiliicoccales representative. This conserved domain has been previously identified in proteins involved in interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes and was never reported in archaea [55] suggesting an adaptation to digestive tracts unique to Methanomassiliicoccales among archaea
						x	A pool of genes conserved among all methanogens and not found in any other archaea was recently determined by Kaster et al.[57]. These genes encode the subunits of two enzymatic complexes unique and shared by all methanogens, the methyl-H4MPT: coenzyme M methyltransferase (Mtr) and the methyl coenzyme reductase (two complexes of isoenzymes Mcr and Mrt), as well as proteins of unknown function.
						x	The lack of Mtr and the other genes of the CO2-reductive pathway in the three Methanomassiliicoccales described here, prompted us to reevaluate the overall methanogenesis markers. In addition to the five genes coding for subunits of the Mtr enzymatic complex, two former methanogenesis markers (annotated as methanogenesis markers 10 and 14 in the databases and belonging to arCOG00950 and arCOG04866, respectively) are absent from the three Methanomassiliicoccales genomes (Table 5).
							Fifteen genes present in the three Methanomassiliicoccales genomes have homologues (and/or paralogs in the case of atwA and the mcr/mrt operons) conserved in all other methanogens and not in other archaea and could still be considered as methanogenesis markers (Table 5).
						x	The exergonic reduction of the heterodisulfide CoM-S-S-CoB formed by the Mcr complex is a crucial step for energy conservation conserved in all methanogens. The three genomes harbor at least one copy of hdrA, hdrB and hdrC homologues encoding a soluble heterodisulfide reductase (Table 6), HdrB representing the catalytic activity for CoM-S-S-CoB reduction. The current HdrA differs from its homologues present in other methanogens by its longer size and the presence of two predicted FAD-binding sites instead of one, and three 4Fe-4S centers instead of four.

						x	The complexity of the cell wall and membrane biosynthesis pathways (COG ‘M’) in the episymbionts compared with other Epsilonproteobacteria are reflected in the abundance of genes found in this category. It is the most represented COG category, accounting for 8% of the EM-C.

						unclear	Furthermore, nucleotide clustering [using D2 cluster (30)] revealed significant amounts of repetitive DNA, which are likely associated with genomic islands and serine/aspartic acid-rich regions of adhesion factors as they are in other epsilonproteobacterial genomes (31).

They are present, however, in the Epsilonproteobacteria pathogen genomes—indicating free glucose utilization as an energy source.
						x	A portion of the episymbiont consortia likely generates energy via pyruvate synthesis from glucose, as all of the enzymes in the pathway are present (Table S3). Although we detected all enzymes to run TCA in the forward direction, sequences encoding ATP citrate lyase subunits were much more abundant (at least 8:1) than those with homology to citrate synthase.

Some microorganisms have alternative nitrogenases in which the dinitrogenase protein contains vanadium instead of molybdenum, encoded by the vnf genes, or only iron, encoded by the anf genes. All nifH genes fall into one of four clusters (Chien and Zinder, 1994): cluster I includes standard molybdenum nitrogenases from cyanobacteria and proteobacteria (α, β and γ), as well as γ-proteobacterial vnfH; and cluster II includes methanogen nitrogenases and bacterial anfH. Cluster III includes nitrogenases from diverse anaerobic bacteria such as clostridia (low G+C, Gram-positive) and sulfate reducers (δ-proteobacteria), which is an example of the NifH phylogeny deviating from the 16S rRNA phylogeny. Some methanogens within the order Methanosarcinales have one nifH gene in cluster II and another copy called nifH2 in cluster III, which is believed to be an example of horizontal gene transfer between methanogens and clostridia (Raymond et al., 2004). Cluster IV includes divergent nitrogenases from methanogens, many of which are not able to fix nitrogen.
							Cluster III includes nitrogenases from diverse anaerobic bacteria such as clostridia (low G+C, Gram-positive) and sulfate reducers (δ-proteobacteria), which is an example of the NifH phylogeny deviating from the 16S rRNA phylogeny. Some methanogens within the order Methanosarcinales have one nifH gene in cluster II and another copy called nifH2 in cluster III, which is believed to be an example of horizontal gene transfer between methanogens and clostridia (Raymond et al., 2004).
							Cluster IV includes divergent nitrogenases from methanogens, many of which are not able to fix nitrogen.
							Hydrothermal vent fluid originating from hot anaerobic zones in the subseafloor primarily contained nifH genes from anaerobic bacteria related to sulfate reducers and clostridia (cluster III), while hydrothermal fluid with a strong seawater component was dominated by unique putative archaeal nifH genes distantly related to methanogens.
					already used in another sentence		In order to rule out the possibility that the deep-sea nifH genes belong to methanogens too low in abundance to be detected using 16S rRNA primers, the methyl coenzyme-M reductase (mcrA) gene, which is specific to methanogens, was targeted.
							The deep-sea nifH genes fall exclusively into cluster II (Fig. 2), which is known to contain only archaeal and alternative nitrogenases. As alternative nitrogenase genes from bacteria only occur concurrently with molybdenum nitrogenases from cluster I or III (Raymond et al., 2004), neither of which was detected, it is likely that the deep-sea nifH genes have an archaeal source

In earlier studies, the SoxB-encoding gene has been used as a marker gene and its presence has been demonstrated in reference strains from the Alpha-, Beta-, Gammaproteobacteria and Chlorobi (Petri et al., 2001; Meyer et al., 2007). The sox genes have also been found within the genomes of certain Epsilonproteobacteria, strongly indicating that they use the Sox pathway for sulfur oxidation (Nakagawa et al., 2007; Sievert et al., 2008b).
						x	Dissimilatory APS reductase (AprBA) is also a key enzyme of the dissimilatory sulfate-reduction pathway in sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (Meyer & Kuever, 2007b).  However, the enzyme is found in a wide variety of sulfur-oxidizing prokaryotes, where it is most likely involved in the reverse process, the transformation of sulfite to APS (Meyer & Kuever, 2007a). 
						x	. In this context, it should be mentioned that Epsilonproteobacteria of group D cannot oxidize reduced sulfur compounds, but rely on hydrogen as an energy source. Consequently, their genomes lack the sox genes (Campbell et al., 2009).
						x	Autotrophic Epsilonproteobacteria have been shown to use the reductive TCA cycle for CO2 fixation with a bona fide ATP citrate lyase as the key enzyme (Hügler et al., 2005; Takai et al., 2005; Voordeckers et al., 2008). In this study, various epsilonproteobacterial aclB sequences were found clustering mainly with sequences from groups F and D. This indicates the potential of Epsilonproteobacteria at the Irina II site to fix CO2 via the reductive TCA cycle.
						x	AprA genes of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria form APR lineage I, while sequences from sulfate-reducers form lineage II (Fig. 3b). However, the aprA genes of several sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, such as those of Beggiatoa spp., Thiobacillus spp. or the endosymbiont of Riftia pachyptila, cluster within lineage II, indicating lateral gene transfer of the apr genes (Meyer & Kuever, 2007a).
							Although sulfur-oxidizing members of the Gammaproteobacteria have been isolated frequently from vent sites, our knowledge of their sulfur-oxidation pathways is rather limited. Some strains, for example Thiomicrospira crunogena XCL-2, seem to use the complete Sox enzyme system (Scott et al., 2006), while others such as Beggiatoa and the endosymbiont of the tubeworm R. pachyptila use alternative pathways (Hagen & Nelson, 1997; Markert et al., 2007). The huge variety of gammaproteobacterial aprA genes found in this study indicates that Gammaproteobacteria at the Irina II site mainly use the APS pathway for sulfur oxidation.
						x	At least some strains also have the capability to use the CBB cycle for carbon fixation because we found several gammaproteobacterial cbbM gene sequences, encoding RubisCO form II (Table 1, Fig. S3). It has been postulated that RubisCO form II is used in niches with high CO2 and low O2 levels, while RubisCO form I works best in a low-CO2 and high-O2 environment (Badger & Bek, 2008). In line with this hypothesis, we were only able to amplify the cbbM gene.

This well-characterized system for the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds has been studied in facultatively chemolithoautotrophic, aerobic, thiosulfate-oxidizing alphaproteobacteria, including Paracococcus versutus GB17, Thiobacillus versutus, Starkeya novella, and Pseudoaminobacter salicylatoxidans ([32,34] and references therein). This model involves a periplasmic multienzyme complex that is capable of oxidizing various reduced sulfur compounds completely to sulfate. Genes encoding components of this complex have been identified, and it has further been shown that these so-called “sox” genes form extensive clusters in the genomes of the aforementioned bacteria.
						x	Genome analyses also reveal the presence of a putative sulfide:quinone reductase gene (Tcr1170; SQR). This enzyme is present in a number of phototrophic and chemotrophic bacteria and is best characterized from Rhodobacter capsulatus
							Thiom. crunogena XCL-2 apparently also lacks a sulfite:acceptor oxidoreductase (SorAB), an enzyme evolutionarily related to SoxCD that catalyzes the direct oxidation of sulfite to sulfate and that has a wide distribution among different sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Figure S1).
						x	All 14 genes for the subunits of an electrogenic NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDH-1) are present (Tcr0817–0830) and are organized in an apparent operon, as in other proteobacteria [48,49].
						x	Unlike most bacteria, Thiom. crunogena XCL-2 does not synthesize the isopentenyl diphosphate units that make up the lipid portion of ubiquinone via the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate pathway.
						x	Consistent with its microaerophilic lifestyle and inability to use nitrate as an electron acceptor [6], the only terminal oxidase present in the Thiom. crunogena XCL-2 genome is a cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase (Tcr1963–5). To date, Helicobacter pylori is the only other sequenced organism that has solely a cbb3-type oxidase, and this has been proposed to be an adaptation to growth under microaerophilic conditions [49], since cbb3-type oxidase has a higher affinity for oxygen than aa3-type oxidase does [56].
						x	In ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, representatives of this protein superfamily (NE0102, Neut2204, and NmulA0344 in the COG4654 protein family; and Noc0751, NE0736, and Neut1650 in the COG2863 protein family) are the key electron carriers that connect the bc1 complex with complex IV as well as NOx-detoxifying reductases (i.e., NirK and NirS) and oxidases (i.e., cytochrome P460 and cytochrome c peroxidase) involved in nitrifier denitrification ([57] and references therein).
						x	In Epsilonproteobacteria, such as He. pylori and He. hepaticus, cytochromes in this family (jhp1148 and HH1517) interact with the terminal cytochrome cbb3 oxidase.
						x	Unlike many other bacteria [67], the gene encoding the sole SulP-type ion transporter (Tcr1533) does not have a carbonic anhydrase gene adjacent to it.
						x	Many sequenced genomes from autotrophic bacteria have recently become available and provide a unique opportunity to determine whether CBB gene organization differs among autotrophs based on their lifestyle. Indeed, for all obligate autotrophs, RubisCO genes are not located near the genes encoding the other enzymes of the CBB cycle (Figure 6; Table S4). For example, the distance on the chromosome of these organisms between the genes encoding the only two enzymes unique to the CBB cycle, RubisCO (cbbLS and/or cbbM) and phosphoribulokinase (cbbP), ranges from 139–899 kilobase pairs (kbp) in Proteobacteria, and 151–3,206 kbp in the Cyanobacteria. In contrast, for most facultative autotrophs, cbbP and cbbLS and/or cbbM genes are near each other (Figure 6); in most cases, they appear to coexist in an operon. In the facultative autotroph Rhodospirillum rubrum, the cbbM and cbbP genes occupy adjacent, divergently transcribed operons (cbbRM and cbbEFPT).
							The lack of CBB enzyme operons in obligate autotrophs from the Alpha-. Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, as well as the Cyanobacteria, may reflect a lack of selective pressure for these genes to be juxtaposed in their chromosomes for ease of coordinate repression during heterotrophic growth.
						x	All of the genes necessary for an oxidative CAC are potentially present, as in some other obligate autotrophs and methanotrophs [18,78].

Pathogenic species have fewer signal transduction proteins than their free-living counterparts, even when genome size is taken into account [39], as is the case among sequenced Epsilonproteobacteria. N. profundicola, Nitratiruptor sp. SB155-2, and Sulfurovum sp. NBC37-1 each have over 100 signal transduction genes, while most strains of Campylobacter and Helicobacter have about half as many, most of which code for histidine kinases, response regulators, or methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins.
						x	Free-living Epsilonproteobacteria have many genes containing diguanylate cyclase (GGDEF) and phosphodiesterase (EAL) domains, whereas Campylobacter and Helicobacter genomes have only a few or none.
							N. profundicola is the only vent Epsilonproteobacterium that also has the HD-GYP domain, another phosphodiesterase. Given its smaller genome size and comparatively limited metabolism, its numerous coding sequences for cyclic diguanylate signaling relative to other vent organisms seems counterintuitive.
						x	At the time of writing, 22 out of 26 sequenced Epsilonproteobacteria have the luxS and pfs genes, with only four Campylobacter species lacking the AI-2 system. While LuxS has been shown to affect biofilm formation, motility, type III secretion, and the production of virulence factors and toxins in pathogens, it remains unclear whether AI-2 is truly a universal signal or simply a metabolic byproduct for most bacterial strains [43]–[45]. In support of the widespread nature of LuxS/Pfs in Epsilonproteobacteria, the metagenome of the A. pompejana episymbionts contains 36 luxS sequences and 49 pfs sequences [46]. The abundance of these genes in Epsilonproteobacteria at hydrothermal vents may offer a mechanism through which this group dominates episymbiont communities.
						x	All the vent Epsilonproteobacteria as well as S. denitrificans and A. butzleri contain homologs to the second arsenate reductase (GAmH_0397 in N. profundicola). W. succinogenes, Sulfurovum, Nitratiruptor, and S. denitrificans contain an apparent operon that encodes an arsenite permease and regulatory protein, ArsR [18],[31],[61], whereas both N. profundicola and C. mediatlanticus lack an arsenical permease homolog (COG1055), but contain an arsR homolog (GAmH_0374) elsewhere.
						x	There are several genes in N. profundicola and other vent Epsilonproteobacteria that encode proteins directly or peripherally involved in resistance to toxins. One of these is a member of the Nudix family of proteins that clean the cell of toxic nucleotide metabolites [56]. This gene (GAmH_1363) is predicted to encode ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase and is found only in the vent epsiloproteobacterial and Arcobacter butzleri genomes and not in pathogenic Epsilonproteobacteria [18],[57].

The archaeal RHP pathway only differs in a few steps from the CBB cycle and might be a primitive carbon metabolic pathway utilizing RuBisCO that later evolved to the photosynthetic Calvin–Benson cycle [50].

						x	Both genomes contain the gene for form II ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCo) large subunit (cbbM), closely related to other Mariprofundus species cbbM genes (Fig. S2); cbbM is an essential gene for inorganic carbon fixation and is consistent with our growth observations in the laboratory (37).
						x	Though the genomes contain the gene for form II RuBisCo, they do not contain the gene for form I RuBisCo (cbbL). This observation is consistent with findings in other Zetaproteobacteria, for example, strains CP-5, CP-8, EKF-M39, TAG-1, and SV-108 (21, 36, 40).
						x	The genomes of many microaerophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria, originating from both freshwater and marine habitats, contain homologs of an outer membrane cytochrome protein (Cyc2) (42), which has been shown to oxidize Fe(II) in the acidophilic Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (43).
						x	The presence of the alternative respiratory complex III (AC-III) is a common feature in many Zetaproteobacteria and other Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (36), and it has been hypothesized that they are able to use the AC-III, which is thought to be analogous to the bc1 complex, as well as a molybdopterin oxidoreductase (encoded by the actB gene) to facilitate Fe(II) oxidation (35).
						x	Homologs of cbb3-type oxidases have been found in almost all Zetaproteobacteria genomes, aside from strains CP-5 and CP-8
							However, aa3-type cytochromes are present in other Zetaproteobacteria, such as strain TAG-1 (36), Mariprofundus micogutta (56), and several SAGs (40), which generally also contain a cbb3-type oxidase.

This pathway is previously reported in anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing Planctomycetes, sulfate-reducing bacteria and in autotrophic Archaeoglobales (Berg, 2011).

Among anaerobes, CO dehydrogenases are present in microorganisms that form or degrade acetate via the acetyl-CoA pathway found both in the representatives of Archaea and Bacteria domains. Among bacteria, it was found in acetogenic (Drake 1994), sulfate-reducing (see, e.g., Fukui et al. 1999) and some photosynthetic bacteria (Uffen 1983; Ensign 1995); and among archaea, in a variety of methanogens, including species of Methanosarcina, Methanothrix, and Methanocaldococcus (Ferry 1999), and in nonmethanogenic archaea like Archeoglobus fulgidus (Möller-Zinkhan and Thauer 1990) and Ferroglobus placidus (Vorholt et al. 1997).
						x	The genus Thiomicrospira includes sulfide-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs possessing RubisCO form II (cbbM) in addition to form I (cbbL) (Tourova et al. 2006)
							Our results indicate that diverse putative chemolithoautotrophs possessing cbbM genes are likely to be present in the rocks, sands and sulfide chimneys on the seafloor of the Suiyo Seamount hydrothermal field, which have been unrecognized previously (Elsaied et al. 2007).

29521452	Environ Microbiol	Genomes of ubiquitous marine and hypersaline Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira spp. encode a diversity of mechanisms to sustain chemolithoautotrophy in heterogeneous environments	https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.14090	N		x	Chemolithoautotrophic bacteria from the genera Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira are common, sometimes dominant, isolates from sulfidic habitats including hydrothermal vents, soda and salt lakes and marine sediments. Their genome sequences confirm their membership in a deeply branching clade of the Gammaproteobacteria. Several adaptations to heterogeneous habitats are apparent. Their genomes include large numbers of genes for sensing and responding to their environment (EAL- and GGDEF-domain proteins and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins) despite their small sizes (2.1–3.1 Mbp).
							Many members of Hydrogenovibrio and Thiomicrorhabdus have large tandem repeats preceding a gene encoding protein kinase (e.g., Tcr_0106; Fig. 2). Hydrogenovibrio halophilus lacks an ortholog to this protein kinase, as well as the repeated regions.
							Genes encoding large proteins (up to 4456 aa) have been annotated upstream from the protein kinase genes, and in many cases these large genes include the large tandem repeats (Fig. 2). These genes are variously annotated as Ig-like domain proteins or VCBS repeat containing proteins, and many fall within Pfam13519 (von Willebrand factor type A domain) or TIGR01965 (VCBS repeat).
						x	Genes with MCP domains are very abundant in members of Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira (11–23 genes per genome; Fig. 3), particularly when compared with other members of family Piscirickettsiaceae (0–13 genes per genome, median = 4).
						x	Organisms capable of energy taxis often have large numbers of MCP genes (Alexandre et al., 2004), and this is the case for the genera studied here. MCP genes with PAS domains comprise the largest of the 28 clusters (MCP-PAS8/PAS9-CZB; Fig. 4).
						x	As a result, several taxa carry multiple sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase genes, and this is also the case for other members of ‘Proteobacteria’ (Supporting Information Table S3).
						x	Most of the members of Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira also carry one or multiple copies of flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase (SDH; EC 1.8.1.19; Table 3). These genomes encode a particularly large number of copies of this enzyme (up to 4); other members of ‘Proteobacteria’ typically carry fewer (1–2; Supporting Information Table S3).
						x	Members of the genera Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira carry genes encoding the complete thiosulfate-oxidizing multienzyme system (‘Sox complex’, encoded by soxABCDXYZ) associated with the Kelly–Friedrich pathway, which can oxidize thiosulfate completely to sulfate without the formation of any free intermediates in the cell or locale. These genes are not collocated in a single operon, similar to H. crunogenus (Scott et al., 2006), suggesting that they may be differentially regulated. Most of the the ‘Proteobacteria’ surveyed here carry soxABXYZ instead (Supporting Information Table S3); this ‘incomplete’ Sox complex may produce polysulfide or elemental sulfur (Frigaard and Dahl, 2009).
						x	As has been noted for H. crunogenus (Scott et al., 2006), members of Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira lack dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DSR); this enzyme is common in photosynthetic sulfur oxidizing bacteria, which use it to oxidize sulfide and elemental sulfur to sulfite (Frigaard and Dahl, 2009). This complex is also encoded in the genomes of many chemolithoautotrophic members of ‘Proteobacteria’ (Supporting Information Table S3). Its absence in Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira is consistent with previous studies which noted that the DSR complex is absent from organisms carrying genes encoding a complete Sox complex that includes SoxCD (Frigaard and Dahl, 2009; Gregersen et al., 2011). Genes encoding enzymes to oxidize sulfite directly (SorAB, SoeABC) or indirectly (dissimilatory APS reductase) are also absent from their genomes, though these genes are common among other ‘Proteobacteria’ (Supporting Information Table S3).
						x	All of them also carry genes encoding NDH-1-type NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (NADH dehydrogenase, EC 1.6.5.3), cytochrome bc1 complex (EC 1.10.2.2) and a cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1), which facilitates growth under low oxygen conditions (Pitcher and Watmough, 2004) and has been purified and characterized from Tms. aerophila (Sorokin et al., 1999).
						x	Genes encoding group 1d (oxygen-tolerant) and 2b (sensory) hydrogenases are present in both H. marinus and H. thermophilus MA2–6, and both are capable of growth with hydrogen gas as the electron donor (Hansen and Perner, 2016). Genes encoding group 1d hydrogenase are common among the members of Gammaproteobacteria (Supporting Information Table S4).
						x	Two, and often three, genes encoding RubisCO are present in genomes from members of Hydrogenovibrio and Thiomicrorhabdus (Table 4); it is more common among ‘Proteobacteria’ for genomes to include one or two of these genes (Supporting Information Table S5).
						x	Genomes of most members of Thiomicrospira encode only carboxysomal RubisCO (form IAc) and not form II (Table 4), confirming results from PCR-based assays for these enzymes (Tourova et al., 2006).

Similar to the other members of the lineage [21], including XCL-2, SP-41 carries the genes for a cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1). This enzyme is found mostly in Proteobacteria, but with representants spread across all bacterial phyla [36], and is typically expressed under microaerophilic conditions [37].

						x	While the reasons for the abundance of CRISPR loci in thermophilic methanogens are unknown, it is part of a larger trend in thermophiles that is discussed further below. Nevertheless, while the abundance of CRISPRs in Methanocaldococcus genomes is striking, it does not fully explain the large percentage of matches between the marine vent virome and Methanocaldococcus spacers.
						x	Most notably, a small number of mesophilic bacteria contain relatively large numbers of spacers in their genomes. While these cases are unusual and should be studied in further detail, they constitute a small minority of mesophilic bacteria: 85% of the over 800 sequenced mesophilic bacteria have between 0 and 2 CRISPR loci.

Homologues of this gene have been found in photo- and chemotrophic sulfur oxidizers, in which it is thought to work in reverse direction, converting sulfite to APS (Frigaard and Dahl, 2009).
