S	SA1	PMID:23209211	Genes for ammonia oxidation and an ammonium transporter, as well as those potentially involved in energy conservation (including genes encoding multicopper oxidase and blue copper domain-containing proteins), that were found in “Ca. Nitrosopumilus maritimus” also were observed in the AR2 genome.
S	SA2	PMID:24907263	genomes of members of the Thaumarchaeota encode an FtsZ homologue,
S	SA3	PMID:24907263	Nitrososphaeria: Cultivated strains within this class possess genes of both FtsZ- and Cdv-based cell division systems and have a topoisomerase IB. Similar to euryarchaeal strains, but in contrast to crenarchaeal strains, they have DNA polymerases B and D, eukaryote-like histones (H3/H4) and only one  copy of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen and lack genes for RNA polymerase G
S	SA4	PMID:24907263	Additionally, genes encoding an ammonia monooxygenase have been found exclusively in all lineages within the class, among all archaeal taxa described, and might therefore be considered a distinctive feature.
S	SA5	PMID:24907263	So far, all investigated genomes of members of this class contain genes encoding key enzymes of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, suggesting that members of the phylum Thaumarchaeota might assimilate their cellular carbon via a modified version of this pathway
S	SA6	PMID:24907263	Furthermore, the genome of EN76T carries genes for proteins belonging to the ferritin/Dps domain proteins (Nvie_002890, Nvie_017250, Nvie_020180, Nvie_028750, Nvie_029390), which have also been identified in genomes of other members of the
S	SA7	PMID:25587132	As with all previously sequenced Thaumarchaeota, no hydroxylamine oxidoreductase homologs were identified.
S	SA8	PMID:25587132	However, no homologs of norB were identified in Ca. N. brevis or in any other thaumarchaeal genome.
S	SA9	PMID:22003381	There are only six arCOGs that are present in T. tenax but not in other Crenarchaeota. One of them is DNA uptake protein DprA (TTX_0242), which is encoded in a predicted operon with another functionally related protein ComF (TTX_0243), which was never before detected in archaeal genomes and apparently has been transferred horizontally from Bacteria.
S	SA10	PMID:22003381	T. tenax has not lost any of the 234 arCOGs present in all Crenarchaeota, including nine that are not present in any euryarchaeal genomes. The latter set includes five genes that are shared with Eucarya: the recently described small RPB8 subunit of DNA-directed RNA polymerase (TTX_1930) [95], a Zn-finger containing protein, an apparent transcription elongation factor 1 ortholog (TTX_1715), and ribosomal proteins S25e, S26e and S30e (TTX_0177, TTX_0164, TTX_0151 and TTX_0161 (Table S7).
S	SA11	PMID:24743558	In contrast, the cultured N. maritimus lacks the genes required for utilization of urea.
S	SA12	PMID:24743558	The presence of urease genes within MGI SAGs confirms their potential for urea utilization in the mesopelagic
S	SA13	PMID:22003381	Genes encoding the stable RNA components of RNaseP or the signal recognition particle (7S RNA) are absent, like in most other Thermoproteaceae
S	SA14	PMID:24907263	Genes for urea utilization were recently also found in metagenomic analyses of marine group I thaumarchaeotes from Arctic and meso-/bathypelagic waters and marine sediments
S	SA15	PMID:22675596	H. xanaduensis has several genes involved in polysaccharide synthesis and transport that are not found in any other sequenced haloarchaea. It has two genes (Halxa_0209, Halxa_2361) belonging to the Capsular Polysaccharide Exporter family (TC 9.A.41). This is unusual as one of the members of this family is thought to transport polysaccharide across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria
S	SA16	PMID:22675596	H. xanaduensis also has one gene (Halxa_2364) related to PseG, a UDP-sugar hydrolase involved in polysaccharide production [41]. The presence of these genes in H. xanaduensis suggests that it may be capable of extracellular polysaccharide synthesis using a process unlike any found in other haloarchaea.
S	SA17	PMID:23160063	Unusual for archaea, many representatives of the haloarchaea harbor multiple large (>100 kbp) replicons classed as chromosomes if they host “essential” genes or as megaplasmids if they do not (DasSarma et al. 2009).
S	SA18	PMID:23160063	Haloarchaeal genomes are known to harbor inteins
S	SA19	PMID:23160063	Most haloarchaeal genomes have a higher proportion guanine and cytosine bases that cause an increase in erroneous identification of start and stop codons for most gene calling algorithms
S	SA20	PMID:25978546	In addition to the membrane-bound succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II; HLASF_1576-1579) of the TCA cycle, the Complex I oxidoreductase provides another electron entry point in the HSR2 respiratory chain. Complex I genes were found in many genomes of anaerobic Archaea including Archaeoglobus, Thermoproteus and several methanogens. Only 11 of the 14 Complex I subunits are observed in most of these organisms (Siebers et al., 2011). Three other subunits, catalyzing NADH binding and oxidation in Complex I of aerobes, are replaced by nonhomologous ferredoxin- or F420-oxidizing subunits
S	SA21	PMID:25978546	The HSR2 genome lacks genes encoding cytochrome c-oxidases found in aerobic prokaryotes and any atypical variants of cytochromes found in anaerobic bacteria.
S	SA22	PMID:22003381	The presence of the three subunits for NADH binding and oxidation (Nqo1–3 or NuoEFG, NuoG gives ambiguous results) is so far rare for an anaerobic Archaeum.
S	SA23	PMID:11572479	Like all other aerobic organisms, the gene for superoxide dismutase2,40–42 was also present in this organism (ST2283).
S	SA24	PMID:23468838	More enrichments and isolates of AOA have been obtained subsequently [7]–[14], confirming the presence of putative ammonia monooxygenase subunits (i.e. amoA, amoB and amoC) within the genomes of Thaumarchaeota.
S	SA26	PMID:27030530	The most important characteristic of AOA is their possession of archaeal amoA gene, which codes for the α-subunit of ammonia monooxygenase, the key enzyme responsible for ammonia oxidation. Using amoA as gene marker, recent investigations revealed that AOA occurred with great abundances in sites such as marine environment and acidic soils5,6.
S	SA27	PMID:27030530	Urea was an alternative nitrogen and energy source for some AOA strains such as Nitrososphaera viennensis18, “Ca. Nitrososphaera gargensis”35 and “Ca. Cenarchaeum symbiosum”36, with urease and urea transporter gene identified in their genome (Supplementary Table S3).
S	SA28	PMID:27030530	Ectoine/hydroxyectoine were synthesized from L-aspartate-β-semialdehyde, with four enzymes (EctB, EctA, EctC and EctD) participating in that process (Supplementary Fig. S9a)46. Genes coding for these four enzymes were all found in the genome of Nitrosopumilus maritimus22 (Supplementary Table S3), which facilitated its adaptation to salinity higher than 3.5%, but absent from the genome of the SAT1.
S	SA29	PMID:27030530	Mannosylglycerate could be used for high osmosis and heat stress protection, and it is synthesized from 3-phosphoglycerate and GDP- mannose via a two-step pathway (Supplementary Fig. S9b)47. Two genes responsible for this pathway were identified in “Ca. Nitrososphaera gargensis” and “Ca. Nitrososphaera evergladensis”19,35, but not in the genome of the SAT1.
S	SA30	PMID:27030530	When cells were in hypo-osmosis environment, the MscL channel could pump hydrated solutes, e.g. potassium, out of the cell. This caused a rapid decrease in cytoplasmic hydrated solutes concentrations, lowered the osmotic driving force for water entry, and protected the cells against lysis49. This channel was present in the genomes of a nearby low-salinity adapted AOA “Ca. Nitrosotenuis uzonensis” and another low salinity strain “Ca. Nitrosoarchaeum limnia” SFB117, but absent from the genome of Nitrosopumilus spp. strain, which lived mainly in high-salinity marine environment22,33,50.
S	SA31	PMID:27030530	Several surveys had demonstrated that Group I.1b (mainly wastewater cluster D) AOA were the most dominant in WWTPs, then was WWC-B within Group I.1a, but Nitrosopumilus spp. AOA were rarely found7,10,13. Taking genomic properties into consideration, the former two clusters all contained genes coding for flagella and pili17,19,26,35, while Nitrosopumilus spp. AOAs were lack of them22,33,50.
S	SA32	PMID:29945179	The first confirmed archaeal sulfate reducers were in the hyperthermophilic genus Archaeoglobus (Topt = 85°C) (Stetter et al.1987), which share gene homologs for sulfate adenyltransferase (Sat), adenylyl sulfate reductase (AprAB) and sulfite reductase (DsrABD) with bacteria (Klenk et al.1997); recent genome sequence data suggest that the archaeon T tenax has also the requisite genes for sulfate reduction (Siebers et al.2011).
S	SA33	PMID:29945179	Most extremely thermophilic archaea have a modified Embden-Meyerhof central glycolysis pathway which converts glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) in a single step via a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase. This bypasses two steps normally found in E-M glycolysis, the reduction of GAP via glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ATP production via phosphoglycerate kinase. Thus, the pathway from glucose to pyruvate is a net zero ATP process when considering only substrate phosphorylation.
S	SA34	PMID:29945179	Hydrogenases, which catalyze the reversible reaction between protons, an electron source and hydrogen, can be classified into three types based on the metal content in the catalytic site: [NiFe], [FeFe] and mononuclear Fe hydrogenases but, for reasons that are not clear, the [FeFe]-enzymes have yet to be found in any of the archaea
S	SA35	PMID:29945179	The NiFe-enzymes are ubiquitous and the extremely thermophilic archaeon P. furiosus possesses three such enzymes. One is membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH) and two are in the cytoplasm (SHI and SHII).
S	SA36	PMID:29945179	Most members of the Thermococcales contain genes encoding at least one MBH and one SH (Schut et al.2013).
S	SA37	PMID:29945179	Two H2 production membrane complexes have been identified in the genus of T. onnurineus: formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) (Takacs et al.2008; Kim et al.2010, 2013; Kozhevnikova et al.2016).
S	SA38	PMID:29945179	While there are no known archaea utilizing the CBB cycle, type III Rubisco enzymes are found exclusively in archaea, possibly hinting at the evolutionary heritage of this important protein (Sato, Atomi and Imanaka 2007). Thermococcus kodakarensis contains such a version of this Rubisco that is neither affected by nor inactivated by oxygen
S	SA39	PMID:29945179	All methane-generating organisms, including those responsible for methane generation in the human gut, are archaea.
S	SA41	PMID:29945179	A new type of oxidative stress was discovered in P. furiosus, which was subsequently found in virtually all anaerobes, involving the enzyme superoxide reductase (SOR) (Jenney et al.1999).
S	SA42	PMID:23209209	The presence of genes involved in methanogenesis, among them the highly conserved mcrA gene, supports the experimental observations that “Ca. Methanomethylophilus alvus” is a methanogen.
S	SA43	PMID:23209206	The absence of the hydroxylamine oxidoreductase gene indicates a novel ammonia oxidation pathway in strain AR1, as in the other AOA.
S	SA45	PMID:20421470	The third 2dMCO (Nmar_1354), possessing a fused blue copper-containing domain, has not been found in AOB and appears to be unique to AOA. (two-domain periplasmic multicopper oxidase (2dMCO) containing a fused blue copper-containing domain)
S	SA46	PMID:20421470	However, whereas AOB use the Calvin–Bassham–Benson cycle with the CO2-fixing enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) as the key enzyme, the absence of genes in N. maritimus coding for RubisCO and other enzymes of this cycle points to an alternative pathway for carbon fixation
S	SA47	PMID:20421470	The most likely mechanism supported by the genome sequence is the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway elucidated in the thermophilic crenarchaote Metallosphaera sedula and suggested as a potential pathway of carbon fixation in C. symbiosum
S	SA48	PMID:20421470	The pathway has two parts: a sequence including two carboxylation reactions transforming acetyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA and a multistep sequence converting succinyl-CoA into two molecules of acetyl-CoA. Genes identified in the N. maritimus genome coding for key enzymes of the pathway (Fig. S3) include a biotin-dependent acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase (Nmar_0272–0274), methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase and mutase (Nmar_0953, _0954, and _0958), and 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydratase (Nmar_0207). With the exception of one gene (Nmar_1608), all of the genes implicated in the 3-hydroxyproprionate/4-hydrobutyrate pathway for carbon assimilation in N. maritimus are present and show highest similarity to the genes of C. symbiosum
S	SA49	PMID:20421470	Similarly, M. sedula catalyzes the activation of 3-hydroxypropionate to 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA, using an AMP-forming 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthetase (37). The N. maritimus genome lacks an obvious homolog, although does code for an ADP-forming acyl-CoA synthetase (Nmar_1309) that suggests a more energy efficient alternative.
S	SA50	PMID:20421470	In addition to the genes coding for the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway, the genome of N. maritimus contains a number of genes encoding enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. No homologs for genes coding for a citrate-cleaving enzyme (ATP citrate lyase or citryl-CoA lyase) (38) were identified, permitting exclusion of the reductive TCA cycle as a pathway for carbon fixation.
S	SA51	PMID:20421470	No genomic evidence exists for growth on urea, as N. maritimus lacks the homologs of the putative urease and urea transporter genes identified in C. symbiosum (35).
S	SA52	PMID:20421470	All other sequenced crenarchaea (including C. symbiosum) contain at least 46 tRNAs. N. maritimus lacks tRNA sequences coding for ProCGG or ArgCCG, perhaps resulting from (or related to) the low G + C content of the genome and preference for protein codons ending in A/T.
S	SA53	PMID:20421470	Other archaeal genomes with relatively low G + C content, such as the euryarchaeon Haloquadratum walsbyi, also lack these tRNAs, while possessing the exact complement of 44 tRNAs found in N. maritimus
S	SA54	PMID:20421470	The genome contains at least eight transcription factor B (TFB) and two TATA-box binding protein (TBP) (Table S3) genes required for starting site-specific transcription initiation, making N. maritimus among the densest and richest archaeal genomes for these transcription factors.
S	SA55	PMID:20421470	Although many other archaeal genomes contain multiple copies of these transcription factors, only the haloarchaea have more than five TFB genes
S	SA56	PMID:20421470	The N. maritimus genome contains elements homologous with two systems of cell division: ftsZ (Nmar_1262) and cdvABC (Nmar_0700, _0816, and _1088). The cdvABC operon, induced at the onset of genome segregation and cell division, codes for machinery related to the eukaryotic endosomal sorting complex (49, 50). With the exception of N. maritimus, C. symbiosum, and the Thermoproteales (where the cell division machinery remains uncharacterized), all available archaeal genomes have either the FtsZ or the Cdv cell division machinery, but not both.
S	SA57	PMID:20421470	The genome of N. maritimus also encodes for synthesis of the compatible solute hydroxyectoine: ectoine synthase (ectC, Nmar_1344), a L-2,4-diaminobutyrate transaminase (ectB, Nmar_1345), a L-2,4-diaminobutyrate acetyltransferase (ectA, Nmar_1346), and an ectoine hydroxylase (ectD, Nmar_1343).
S	SA58	PMID:21994921	Although a number of key genes (phaEC and phaB) involved in PHA biosynthesis in H. hispanica have been identified (6, 7), the entire PHA biosynthetic and regulatory networks in haloarchaea remain to be established.
S	SA59	PMID:22247127	Recently, a few enzymes involved in PHA metabolism have been characterized in haloarchaea, such as the PHA synthases (PhaEC) and the PHA-specific acetoacetyl-CoA reductases (PhaB)
S	SA60	PMID:22247127	With the exception of N. pharaonis, all of the species carried the phaE and phaC genes, which all were located adjacent to the phaP-homologous genes.
S	SA61	PMID:22247127	Interestingly, a similar gene cluster composed of maoC-gap12-phaP-phaE-phaC was present in 7 of the 10 species, with the exception of H. utahensis, H. borinquense, and H. jeotgali, which harbored a PGAP gene cluster lacking the maoC gene.
S	SA62	PMID:22247127	Notably, although many proteins are characterized as phasins in bacteria, including PhaP/PhaP1, PhaP2, PhaP3, PhaP4, PhaF, PhaI, the newly identified PhaP5 (25), and phasin-like PhaM (26), the homologous PhaP proteins of H. mediterranei (PhaPhme) only exist in haloarchaea
S	SA63	PMID:22636780	Numerous reports have indicated that IS element transposition has led to extensive chromosomal rearrangements and lateral gene transfer (LGT) in the Pyrococcus genus (13, 16, 22, 27, 58, 60). For example, environmental isolates of Pyrococcus differ in their distribution of IS elements, suggesting a high degree of mobility (58), as has been reported for other hyperthermophilic archaea from freshwater vents
S	SA64	PMID:22636780	The availability of a highly efficient genetically tractable strain of P. furiosus (COM1) has dramatically expanded the potential to study this model hyperthermophilic species. Its sequence not only defines the genetic platform for these future studies but has also provided novel insights into the biology of this organism, including the dynamic nature of its genome and the utility of two classical carbohydrate metabolism genes, gapn and celB.
S	SA65	PMID:22636780	Among the seven IS annotated archaeal genomes (30), P. furiosus harbors far more IS elements (29 full, 6 partial) than does any other member of the Thermococcales but less than a quarter of the IS elements identified in the Sulfolobus solfataricus genome (146 full, 297 partial).
S	SA66	PMID:22636780	In fact, no full-length IS elements have been identified in the genomes of Pyrococcus abyssi or Pyrococcus horikoshii, and only one full-length IS element has been identified in T. kodakarensis (30).
S	SA67	PMID:22636780	GAPN has been shown to be a key glycolytic enzyme in the related euryarchaeon T. kodakarensis, since a strain with a targeted gene knockout (ΔgapN) was unable to grow on malto-oligosaccharides (41). Similarly, GAPN plays a key glycolytic role in various crenarchaeota, including Thermoproteus (5), Aeropyrum (47) and Sulfolobus (1, 17) species.
S	SA68	PMID:22636780	COM1 also lacks the gene encoding CelB, which has been shown to be the cellobiose-hydrolyzing enzyme in P. furiosus that constitutes up to 5% of the total cell protein during growth on this β-1,4-linked disaccharide (29).
S	SA69	PMID:22636780	In P. furiosus, Cas6 has been shown to recognize and cleave foreign RNA that matches spacer sequences present in the host's CRISPR loci (6, 21).
S	SA70	PMID:22843593	H. mediterranei grows faster than most other members of Halobacteriaceae and exhibits remarkable metabolic efficiency and genome stability at high salt concentrations (15, 19) and thus has served as a good model for haloarchaeal physiology and metabolism studies for several decades (1, 3, 5, 11, 13). In particular, H. mediterranei is capable of accumulating poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) from many cheap carbon sources (12, 17, 18). Two key enzymes (PhaEC and PhaB) and a structure protein (PhaP) involved in PHBV biosynthesis have been identified in H. mediterranei
S	SA71	PMID:22843584	The T. cellulolyticus genome also encodes group 3b cytoplasmic NADP-dependent hydrogenase (9), previously not described in Crenarchaeota.
S	SA72	PMID:27617060	The Halorubrum lacusprofundi genome sequence is the first established from a cold-adapted haloarchaeon. The genome has features typical of halophilic Archaea, including high G + C-content, large extrachromosomal replicons, and eukaryotic-like DNA replication and transcription genes.
S	SA73	PMID:22493204	The trichloroacetic acid cycle is incomplete, but a putative aconitase previously unidentified in members of the order Methanocellales (4, 16) was annotated.
S	SA74	PMID:22493191	The inteins found in T. litoralis DNA polymerase B (Vent DNA polymerase) were the first to have Ser or Thr as nucleophiles instead of Cys at both splice junctions (15), and the Tli pol-2 intein was the first to have different N- and C-terminal nucleophiles (Ser and Thr, respectively).
S	SA75	PMID:26413197	Unlike many hydrogenotrophic methanogens, CM1 does not have the gene for [Fe]-hydrogenase dehydrogenase (hmd), or the genes that encode methyl coenzyme M reductase II (mrt), however it does have genes for formate dehydrogenase (MCM1_3047-3048) although CM1 and other M. barkeri strains are unable to use formate [10, 23].
S	SA76	PMID:31958046	Moreover, strains IC-006T, IC-007 and  Sulfolobus metallicus  are placed in a coherent cluster on the 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic tree and this cluster is distantly related to other known species of the order  Sulfolobales . They are also differentiated from the other members of the order  Sulfolobales  in several phenotypic properties such as higher DNA G+C content values and lower growth temperatures (Table S2).
S	SA77	PMID:26383653	Similar with other Thermococcales species, Pa. pacificus possesses an incomplete tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, a modified Embden-Meyerhof pathway to glycolysis and metabolism pathway of proteins and carbohydrates (3–7). The conserved respiration system is also represented by membrane-bound hydrogenase and A0A1-type ATP synthase
S	SA78	PMID:26383653	Different with Pyrococcus species, Pa. pacificus does not contain “saccharolytic gene island” and “maltose and trehalose degradation gene” (5), which carries a set of genes responsible for the utilization of cellulose, laminarin, agar, maltose, trehalose, and other β-linked polysaccharides. These genes are also absent in Thermococcus species except Thermococcus sibiricus (5).
S	SA79	PMID:26383653	Analysis of the repeated sequences and a search against the IS database revealed that a remarkable feature of the Pa. pacificus genome is the absence of mobile genetic elements including transposons, transposases, integrases and virus-related region. It indicates that Pa. pacificus genome has not been subjected to frequent or recent genomic rearrangements during its evolution.
S	SA80	PMID:32759215	The ectosymbiont lacks genes for xenorhodopsin biosynthesis, which occurs in some nanohaloarchaeal MAGs (18).
S	SA81	PMID:32759215	In agreement with this, several sequences related to the diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) locus were found in the LC1Nh genome (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 and Text). This versatile tool for protein diversification that might be involved in mediating the interaction between ectosymbiont and host seems to be prevalent in several DPANN lineages, but has not been reported in Nanohaloarchaeota previously.
S	SA82	PMID:32759215	To start with, Ca. Nanohaloarchaeum antarcticus possesses unusually large SPEARE proteins which are likely involved in attachment to a host. Although homologs of these genes are found in many nanohaloarchaeal genomes, they are absent in Ca. Nanohalobium. Conversely, Ca. Nanohalobium does possess its diversity-generating retroelements locus, which is not seen in other nanohaloarchaeal genomes.
S	SA83	PMID:32759215	Another feature common to all nanohaloarchaea with reconstructed genomes is the presence of organism-specific lectin-like proteins containing one or more of the laminin globular- or Con A-like domains.
S	SA84	PMID:18535141	There are no enzymes for the classical or modified Entner–Doudoroff pathways that are found in many Crenarchaeota.
S	SA85	PMID:18535141	Like all known hyperthermophiles, reverse gyrase is present.
S	SA86	PMID:18535141	Ca. K. cryptofilum possesses a full complement of archaeal DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) subunits. The rpoA and rpoB genes encoding the largest subunits of the RNAP are intact. In addition to the typical archaeal RNAP subunits, a coding region of 110 aa was identified with limited sequence similarity to the RPB8 subunit of the eukaryotic RNAP. Subsequent in-depth analysis has shown that an ortholog of RPB8, previously thought to be missing in archaea, is also encoded by all sequenced genomes of hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeota
S	SA87	PMID:18535141	Notably, r-proteins S30e, S25e, S26e, and L13e that are conserved in the Crenarchaeota but are absent in Euryarchaeota (33) were identified.
S	SA88	PMID:18535141	For example, a type II DNA polymerase and a divergent ftsZ homologue are present in Cenarchaeum symbiosum (48), and histones are also found in mesophilic and some hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeota (49, 50).
S	SA89	PMID:24999826	Ca. N. evergladensis, much like all known chemolithotrophic AOA, is predicted to fix inorganic carbon via a modified 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle.These genes include alpha and beta subunits of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylase, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase and two domains of mutase. Also, biotin-(acetyl-CoA-carboxylase) ligase, which is responsible for assembly of carboxylase subunits, was identified in Ca. N. evergladensis.
S	SA90	PMID:24999826	Unusual enzymes for glycolysis were found in the genome of Ca. N. evergladensis such as multiple kinases (NTE_03124, NTE_00636, NTE_01922) from the ribokinase superfamily that have broad substrate specificity (e. g. glucose, fructose and mannose) and can be candidates for hexokinase and phosphofructokinase enzymes for glycolytic pathway in AOA.
S	SA91	PMID:24999826	The isomerization of glucose-6P/fructose-6P in Nitrososphaera may be catalyzed by either metal-dependent phosphoglucose isomerase (NTE_01540), which belongs to the cupin superfamily and found in the Euryarchaeota or with bifunctional phosphoglucose/phosphomannose isomerase from the sugar isomerases family (NTE_02296).
S	SA92	PMID:24999826	A homolog of pyruvate dikinase was detected in the genome (NTE_02861). Pyruvate dikinase catalyzes reversible interconversion of PEP and pyruvate in Thermopreotei
S	SA93	PMID:24999826	All enzyme homologs of the non-oxidative phase of the hexose monophosphate pathway were identified in Ca. N. evergladensis except 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is missing. This enzyme is one of the key enzymes of the oxidative phase (Figure S6 in File S1, Table S1 in File S2). This enzyme was found in the genome of Ca. N. gargensis but not in other Thaumarchaeota
S	SA94	PMID:24999826	F420-dependent oxidoreductase, G6PDH family has been found in archaeal methanogens, Streptomyces, and Mycobacteria [38], [39].
S	SA95	PMID:24999826	Similar to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), archaea of group I.1b encode several amoC subunits of AMO [42]. However, majority representatives of group I.1.a have only one copy of amoC
S	SA96	PMID:24999826	It is noteworthy that multiple copies of amoC appear more often in AOA and AOB associated with soil environments, which harbor more diverse stressors than marine environments and require more adaptations for organisms to survive and successfully compete [42]. For example, ammonia oxidizers from soil have up to seven amoC copies (Figure S7 in File S1), while marine AOA and AOB usually encode only one amoC
S	SA97	PMID:24999826	Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase was found almost in all representatives of Thaumarchaeota
S	SA98	PMID:24999826	Mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate and myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthases were found in the genomes of group I.1b but not in the genomes of group I.1a.
S	SA99	PMID:24999826	Multiple putative multicopper oxidases are encoded in all known AOA, however, their role in copper tolerance remains unclear
S	SA100	PMID:24999826	Periplasmic divalent cation tolerance protein (NTE_02314) is widely represented in AOA, and may also transport copper outside the cell.
S	SA102	PMID:24999826	Ca. N. evergladensis has three putative nickel transporter genes, and one of these high affinity permeases (NTE_02909) is specific only for this thaumarchaeon.
S	SA103	PMID:24999826	Notably, an arsenic pump was identified only in the genomes of Nitrososphaera species but not in AOA related to Nitrosopumilus.
S	SA104	PMID:24999826	Glutamate synthase (NTE_01407) was found only in the Ca. N. evergladensis genome, and not other sequenced AOA genomes.
S	SA105	PMID:24999826	One of the specific signatures of the known Thaumarchaeota is that their genomes, including Ca. N. evergladensis, are missing gene homologs for r-protein family LXa that is solely present in Archaea. Also, r-proteins L14e and L34e found in other archaeal phyla but not in Thaumarchaeota, are missing from Ca. N. evergladensis.
S	SA106	PMID:24999826	However, in contrast to Euryarchaeota, Crenarchaeota and Nanoarchaeota that have two genes encoding A subunit of RNAP, Ca. N. evergladensis and other Thaumarchaeota contain a single rpoA gene. This unsplit rpoA is common for Eykarya and it was suggested that other archaeal lineages that possess split rpoA branched off later in evolution than the Thaumarchaeota [52].
S	SA107	PMID:24999826	The gene encoding topoisomerase IB, a signature marker for Thaumarchaeota, but not for other archaeal phyla, is present in the Ca. N. evergladensis genome.
S	SA108	PMID:24999826	Similar to other Thaumarchaeota, Ca. N. evergladensis possesses the genes needed to compress and methylate DNA. The DNA repair system of Ca. N. evergladensis includes UvrABC endonuclease, which is common in mesophilic archaea
S	SA109	PMID:28077874	Next, to gain further insight into the emergence of eukaryotic gene content,we identified potential eukaryotic signature proteins (ESPs) in the reconstructed Asgard genomes. Notably, all Asgard lineages were found to be enriched for such ESPs, suggesting that these are widespread across the Asgard superphylum. ESPs identified in the new Asgard genomes previously identified in the composite Lokiarchaeum genome11,14 included an expanded set of the composite Lokiarchaeum genome11,14 included an expanded set of GTPases (Extended Data Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 8), eukaryotic RLC7 family proteins (Supplementary Fig. 1), actin homologues (Supplementary Fig. 2), gelsolin-domain proteins, components of eukaryotic ESCRT (I, II and III) systems including two sub-families of SNF7 proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3), ubiquitin modifier system components (Supplementary Fig. 4) and homologues of eukaryotic protein translocation and glycosylation pathways (Extended Data Table 2, Extended Data Fig. 4).
S	SA110	PMID:28077874	Phylogenetic analyses of the thorarchaeal TRAPP domain proteins revealed that they form a monophyletic group with eukaryotic TRAPPC3 (Bet3 family), TRAPPC5 and TRAPPC6 family proteins.
S	SA111	PMID:28077874	In addition, thorarchaeal genomes encode homologues of eukaryotic Sec23/24 family proteins, which are essential components of COPII, a protein complex responsible for vesicle-mediated ER-to-Golgi transport of protein cargo32. Protein domain and structure prediction analysis of these thorarchaeal Sec23/24 homologues indicate that they contain the zinc-finger, trunk and β-sandwich domains of eukaryotic Sec23/24 family proteins, but lack the C-terminal helical and gelsolin domains
S	SA112	PMID:28077874	The present identification of Sec23/24 domain proteins in all our thorarchaeal genome bins, in addition to the presence of longin domain proteins in Lokiarchaeota11,14 as well as in Heimdall- and Odinarchaeota (Extended Data Table 2, Fig. 1d) prompted us to search for potential coatomer proteins.
S	SA113	PMID:28077874	Notably, thorarchaeal genomes encode several homologues of eukaryotic membrane-trafficking machinery components, including Sec23/24 and TRAPP domains.
