S	SH3	PMID:15466576	Although the Calvin cycle is widely distributed (14, 45), our molecular evidence suggests it is less prevalent in the hydrothermal vent samples we analyzed. This study provides evolutionary insight for the hypothesis that a version of the rTCA cycle was the first autotrophic pathway to have evolved (51) and demonstrates that it is an important carbon fixation pathway in deep-sea hydrothermal vents and potentially in other environments, such as the deep subsurface.
S	SH4	PMID:25133584	The genome harbors pyrophosphate-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) and proton-translocating pyrophosphatase, which have been identified in methanotrophic and thiotrophic Gammaproteobacteria
S	SH5	PMID:25133584	The pentose phosphate pathway (oxidative branch) is known to be the major pathway for NADPH production and well conserved in the genomes of sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria, but the genomes of several, such as Calyptogena endosymbionts, Alkalilimnicola ehrlichei, Thioalkalivibrio strain K90mix and Halorhodospira halophila, do not possess the branch.
S	SH6	PMID:25133584	Genes for an incomplete-type Sox system and a nearly complete Dsr system for oxidation of sulfur compounds such as sulfide, elemental sulfur, thiosulfate and sulfite, are present in the genome, as is the case for several sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria (Figure 4). Among the genes for periplasmic Sox-type sulfur oxidation system, genes for SoxBZYKAX are encoded in a gene cluster, but the genes for SoxCD and their homologues SorAB are missing, as is the case of the incomplete SOX system in other sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria.
S	SH7	PMID:25133584	Genes for the flavoprotein-cytochrome c complex (SoxEF) are present in strain Hiromi 1 and Chromatiaceae species but are absent in Calyptogena clam symbionts and T. crunogena.
S	SH8	PMID:27754478	The methanogenic type of mcrA genes were obtained only from the uppermost sediment at 0.3 mbsf in Hole C0014B (Figure 4) and were phylogenetically related to the mcrA genes of Methanococcoides (Supplementary Figure S5).
S	SH9	PMID:23183981	The mcrA gene encodes the α subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), which catalyzes the methane-forming step in methanogenic archaea (53) and is also involved in oxidation of methane catalyzed by microorganisms of ANME clusters (54).
S	SH10	PMID:30768760	The small genomes of cultivated Nanoarchaeota lack nearly all biosynthetic pathways and have split protein-coding genes (Waters et al., 2003; Wurch et al., 2016; St. John et al., 2019), pointing to a common pattern of genomic reduction and fragmentation.
S	SH12	PMID:30768760	Unlike cultivated Nanoarchaeota, however, the Gua-46 MAG contains a predicted tyrosine-specific transporter (Gua_114), which may allow the nanoarchaeote to uptake this amino acid from the environment. The MC-1 MAG also encodes for genes involved in nucleotide biotransformation that have not been previously identified in cultivated nanoarchaeotes, including a cytidylate kinase (MC-1_488) and a uridylate kinase (MC-1_320).
S	SH14	PMID:30768760	However, MC-1 does encode genes involved in the pentose bisphosphate pathway, previously described in Thermococcus kodakarensis (Fig. 4), which would allow nanoarchaeotal cells to produce 3-phosphoglycerate and bypass the missing steps in glycolysis (Aono et al., 2012; 2015). The pentose bisphosphate pathway typically begins with nucleoside monophosphates, which may be produced by a putative nucleoside kinase (MC_288) that shows 35.1%–37.4% amino acid similarity to nucleoside kinases in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Aeropyrum pernix (Hansen et al., 2007; Aono et al., 2015).
S	SH15	PMID:30768760	The MAGs also contain a mosaic of key nanoarchaeotal features, including CRISPR repeat regions and marker genes for gluconeogenesis and archaeal flagella.
S	SH16	PMID:26371554	While MARTX genes were enriched in host-associated bacteria regardless of their location, YD repeat genes were only significantly enriched in intracellular bacteria. In contrast to YD repeat and MARTX genes, RTX did not show any enrichment in the three defined categories. RTX are therefore widely distributed among bacteria and are just as likely to be found in free-living and host-associated bacteria
S	SH17	PMID:26371554	Genes from the second major class of TRGs, MARTX, that were similar to those from Bathymodiolus symbiont, were significantly enriched in beneficial and pathogenic host-associated bacteria.
S	SH18	PMID:26371554	RTX genes were not preferentially found in host-associated bacteria but were also regularly found in free-living bacteria. Bloom-forming aquatic cyanobacteria had some of the highest numbers of RTX genes (Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 3).
S	SH19	PMID:26371554	Members of the marine Roseobacter clade also had an unusually large number of RTX genes (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). Roseobacter are some of the most abundant bacteria in marine habitats.
S	SH20	PMID:25397946	As no AI-2 receptors have yet been identified in Epsilonproteobacteria, the complete luxS/AI-2 QS circuit remains unclear. Two main classes of AI-2 receptors have been characterized: the LuxP family receptors, found in Vibrio spp. (Chen et al., 2002), and the LrsB family, found in S. typhimurium and other enteric bacteria (Miller et al., 2004).
S	SH21	PMID:23940820	Genes encoding periplasmic nitrate reductase and dissimilatory nitrite reductase were more prevalent in the G1 dataset than in the G2 dataset, especially within the members of Epsilonproteobacteria.
S	SH22	PMID:25124552	Comparative analyses revealed atypical features, such as the scattering of the ribosomal RNA genes in the genome and the absence of eukaryotic-like histone gene otherwise present in most of Euryarchaeota genomes. Previously identified in Thermoplasmatales genomes, these features are presently extended to several completely sequenced genomes of this large evolutionary branch, including MG-II and DHVE2.
S	SH23	PMID:25124552	In particular, the analysis of “Ca. M. alvus” and M. luminyensis methanogenic pathways revealed they lack the 6 step C1-pathway forming methyl-CoM by the reduction of CO2 with H2, otherwise present in all previously sequenced methanogens, fitting with their restriction to H2-dependent methylotrophic methanogenesis [16].
S	SH24	PMID:25124552	Strikingly, 16S and 23S rRNA genes are not clustered and do not form a transcriptional unit as found in most bacterial and archaeal genomes. Among archaea, this unusual characteristic was first documented in Thermoplasmatales [27], but is also found in related lineages such as the uncultured Marine Group II (MG-II) and Aciduliprofundum boonei(Figure 1).
S	SH25	PMID:25124552	The Methanomassiliicoccales, Marine Group II, and DHVE2 harbor both subunits of the archaeal topoisomerase TopoVI, strengthening a specific loss of this gene in Thermoplasmatales, which replaced it by a bacterial-type DNA gyrase [42]. Moreover, all three Methanomassiliicoccales representatives also harbor a bacterial-like DNA gyrase, known to have been acquired from bacteria in late emerging Euryarchaeota [41].
S	SH26	PMID:25124552	An important feature shared by the three Methanomassiliicoccales representatives, the Thermoplasmatales and other related lineages is the lack of Eukaryotic-like histone found in other Euryarchaeota [43], suggesting that the loss of this gene occurred early in the evolution of the whole lineage. Surprisingly, no gene coding for homologues of the bacterial-type HTa histones known to have replaced the native histone in Thermoplasmatales and DHVE2 are present in the Methanomassiliicoccales genomes and the MG-II genome.
S	SH27	PMID:25124552	As usually observed in methanogens, the three species harbors an incomplete reductive TCA cycle [46].
S	SH28	PMID:25124552	Similarly to other methanogens and differently from the Thermoplasmatales representatives, the three Methanomassiliicoccales lack PurK for purine synthesis pathway.
S	SH29	PMID:25124552	Another adaptation to GIT could be inferred through the presence of a conserved amino acid domain corresponding to COG0790 (TPR repeat, SEL1 subfamily) in at least one protein of each Methanomassiliicoccales representative. This conserved domain has been previously identified in proteins involved in interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes and was never reported in archaea [55] suggesting an adaptation to digestive tracts unique to Methanomassiliicoccales among archaea
S	SH30	PMID:25124552	A pool of genes conserved among all methanogens and not found in any other archaea was recently determined by Kaster et al.[57]. These genes encode the subunits of two enzymatic complexes unique and shared by all methanogens, the methyl-H4MPT: coenzyme M methyltransferase (Mtr) and the methyl coenzyme reductase (two complexes of isoenzymes Mcr and Mrt), as well as proteins of unknown function. Being unique to methanogens, these uncharacterized proteins likely have an important role for methanogenesis and could be directly associated to the functioning of Mcr and Mtr [57]. The lack of Mtr and the other genes of the CO2-reductive pathway in the three Methanomassiliicoccales described here, prompted us to reevaluate the overall methanogenesis markers. In addition to the five genes coding for subunits of the Mtr enzymatic complex, two former methanogenesis markers (annotated as methanogenesis markers 10 and 14 in the databases and belonging to arCOG00950 and arCOG04866, respectively) are absent from the three Methanomassiliicoccales genomes (Table 5).
S	SH31	PMID:25124552	The lack of Mtr and the other genes of the CO2-reductive pathway in the three Methanomassiliicoccales described here, prompted us to reevaluate the overall methanogenesis markers. In addition to the five genes coding for subunits of the Mtr enzymatic complex, two former methanogenesis markers (annotated as methanogenesis markers 10 and 14 in the databases and belonging to arCOG00950 and arCOG04866, respectively) are absent from the three Methanomassiliicoccales genomes (Table 5).
S	SH32	PMID:25124552	Fifteen genes present in the three Methanomassiliicoccales genomes have homologues (and/or paralogs in the case of atwA and the mcr/mrt operons) conserved in all other methanogens and not in other archaea and could still be considered as methanogenesis markers (Table 5).
S	SH33	PMID:25124552	The exergonic reduction of the heterodisulfide CoM-S-S-CoB formed by the Mcr complex is a crucial step for energy conservation conserved in all methanogens. The three genomes harbor at least one copy of hdrA, hdrB and hdrC homologues encoding a soluble heterodisulfide reductase (Table 6), HdrB representing the catalytic activity for CoM-S-S-CoB reduction. The current HdrA differs from its homologues present in other methanogens by its longer size and the presence of two predicted FAD-binding sites instead of one, and three 4Fe-4S centers instead of four. The three genomes also contain homologues of hdrD, encoding the catalytic site of a second class of heterodisulfide reductase (HdrDE), but no homologues of hdrEencoding the membrane bound cytochrome subunit of this complex
S	SH34	PMID:25124552	Similarly to the Methanococcales, Methanobacteriales and Methanopyrales, the hdrB and hdrC genes are adjacent whereas the hdrA gene is located apart and in close association with mvhDGAencoding the cytoplasmic F420-non-reducing hydrogenase, absent from members of the Methanosarcinales and some Methanomicrobiales [66].
S	SH36	PMID:18987310	Signal transductions COGs (COG ‘T’) were found in greater abundance in free-living Epsilonproteobacteria (4.5%) and the EM-C (2.8%) compared with pathogens (1.3%)—possibly a result of the stochastic environment characteristic of both the free-living organisms and episymbionts.
S	SH37	PMID:18987310	Two essential enzymes in the Entner Doudoroff pathway (6-phosphogluconate dehydratase and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase) are absent in both the episymbiont dataset and other free-living Epsilonproteobacteria genomes. They are present, however, in the Epsilonproteobacteria pathogen genomes—indicating free glucose utilization as an energy source.
S	SH39	PMID:16156726	Cluster III includes nitrogenases from diverse anaerobic bacteria such as clostridia (low G+C, Gram-positive) and sulfate reducers (δ-proteobacteria), which is an example of the NifH phylogeny deviating from the 16S rRNA phylogeny. Some methanogens within the order Methanosarcinales have one nifH gene in cluster II and another copy called nifH2 in cluster III, which is believed to be an example of horizontal gene transfer between methanogens and clostridia (Raymond et al., 2004).
S	SH40	PMID:16156726	Cluster IV includes divergent nitrogenases from methanogens, many of which are not able to fix nitrogen.
S	SH41	PMID:16156726	Hydrothermal vent fluid originating from hot anaerobic zones in the subseafloor primarily contained nifH genes from anaerobic bacteria related to sulfate reducers and clostridia (cluster III), while hydrothermal fluid with a strong seawater component was dominated by unique putative archaeal nifH genes distantly related to methanogens.
S	SH42	PMID:16156726	In order to rule out the possibility that the deep-sea nifH genes belong to methanogens too low in abundance to be detected using 16S rRNA primers, the methyl coenzyme-M reductase (mcrA) gene, which is specific to methanogens, was targeted.
S	SH43	PMID:25244359	Moreover, most epsilonproteobacterial genomes encode 3–4 rRNA operons, possibly leading to an overrepresentation of Epsilonproteobacteria in sequence data.
S	SH44	PMID:18987310	The complexity of the cell wall and membrane biosynthesis pathways (COG ‘M’) in the episymbionts compared with other Epsilonproteobacteria are reflected in the abundance of genes found in this category. It is the most represented COG category, accounting for 8% of the EM-C.
S	SH45	PMID:18987310	A portion of the episymbiont consortia likely generates energy via pyruvate synthesis from glucose, as all of the enzymes in the pathway are present (Table S3). Although we detected all enzymes to run TCA in the forward direction, sequences encoding ATP citrate lyase subunits were much more abundant (at least 8:1) than those with homology to citrate synthase.
S	SH46	PMID:20597983	Components of a fully functional Sox complex involve SoxB, SoxXA, SoxYZ and SoxCD. In earlier studies, the SoxB-encoding gene has been used as a marker gene and its presence has been demonstrated in reference strains from the Alpha-, Beta-, Gammaproteobacteria and Chlorobi (Petri et al., 2001; Meyer et al., 2007). The sox genes have also been found within the genomes of certain Epsilonproteobacteria, strongly indicating that they use the Sox pathway for sulfur oxidation (Nakagawa et al., 2007; Sievert et al., 2008b).
S	SH47	PMID:20597983	Dissimilatory APS reductase (AprBA) is also a key enzyme of the dissimilatory sulfate-reduction pathway in sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (Meyer & Kuever, 2007b).  However, the enzyme is found in a wide variety of sulfur-oxidizing prokaryotes, where it is most likely involved in the reverse process, the transformation of sulfite to APS (Meyer & Kuever, 2007a).
S	SH48	PMID:20597983	In this context, it should be mentioned that Epsilonproteobacteria of group D cannot oxidize reduced sulfur compounds, but rely on hydrogen as an energy source. Consequently, their genomes lack the sox genes (Campbell et al., 2009).
S	SH49	PMID:20597983	Autotrophic Epsilonproteobacteria have been shown to use the reductive TCA cycle for CO2 fixation with a bona fide ATP citrate lyase as the key enzyme (Hügler et al., 2005; Takai et al., 2005; Voordeckers et al., 2008). In this study, various epsilonproteobacterial aclB sequences were found clustering mainly with sequences from groups F and D. This indicates the potential of Epsilonproteobacteria at the Irina II site to fix CO2 via the reductive TCA cycle.
S	SH50	PMID:20597983	AprA genes of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria form APR lineage I, while sequences from sulfate-reducers form lineage II (Fig. 3b). However, the aprA genes of several sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, such as those of Beggiatoa spp., Thiobacillus spp. or the endosymbiont of Riftia pachyptila, cluster within lineage II, indicating lateral gene transfer of the apr genes (Meyer & Kuever, 2007a).
S	SH51	PMID:20597983	Although sulfur-oxidizing members of the Gammaproteobacteria have been isolated frequently from vent sites, our knowledge of their sulfur-oxidation pathways is rather limited. Some strains, for example Thiomicrospira crunogena XCL-2, seem to use the complete Sox enzyme system (Scott et al., 2006), while others such as Beggiatoa and the endosymbiont of the tubeworm R. pachyptila use alternative pathways (Hagen & Nelson, 1997; Markert et al., 2007). The huge variety of gammaproteobacterial aprA genes found in this study indicates that Gammaproteobacteria at the Irina II site mainly use the APS pathway for sulfur oxidation.
S	SH52	PMID:20597983	At least some strains also have the capability to use the CBB cycle for carbon fixation because we found several gammaproteobacterial cbbM gene sequences, encoding RubisCO form II (Table 1, Fig. S3). It has been postulated that RubisCO form II is used in niches with high CO2 and low O2 levels, while RubisCO form I works best in a low-CO2 and high-O2 environment (Badger & Bek, 2008). In line with this hypothesis, we were only able to amplify the cbbM gene.
S	SH53	PMID:17105352	Genes are present in this genome that encode all of the components essential to assemble a fully functional Sox system that performs sulfite-, thiosulfate-, sulfur-, and hydrogen sulfide–dependent cytochrome c reduction, namely, SoxXA (Tcr0604 and Tcr0601), SoxYZ (Tcr0603 and Tcr0602), SoxB (Tcr1549), and SoxCD (Tcr0156and Tcr0157) [32,33]. This well-characterized system for the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds has been studied in facultatively chemolithoautotrophic, aerobic, thiosulfate-oxidizing alphaproteobacteria, including Paracococcus versutus GB17, Thiobacillus versutus, Starkeya novella, and Pseudoaminobacter salicylatoxidans ([32,34] and references therein). This model involves a periplasmic multienzyme complex that is capable of oxidizing various reduced sulfur compounds completely to sulfate. Genes encoding components of this complex have been identified, and it has further been shown that these so-called “sox” genes form extensive clusters in the genomes of the aforementioned bacteria.
S	SH54	PMID:17105352	Genome analyses also reveal the presence of a putative sulfide:quinone reductase gene (Tcr1170; SQR). This enzyme is present in a number of phototrophic and chemotrophic bacteria and is best characterized from Rhodobacter capsulatus.
S	SH55	PMID:17105352	Thiom. crunogena XCL-2 apparently also lacks a sulfite:acceptor oxidoreductase (SorAB), an enzyme evolutionarily related to SoxCD that catalyzes the direct oxidation of sulfite to sulfate and that has a wide distribution among different sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Figure S1).
S	SH56	PMID:17105352	All 14 genes for the subunits of an electrogenic NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDH-1) are present (Tcr0817–0830) and are organized in an apparent operon, as in other proteobacteria [48,49].
S	SH57	PMID:17105352	Consistent with its microaerophilic lifestyle and inability to use nitrate as an electron acceptor [6], the only terminal oxidase present in the Thiom. crunogena XCL-2 genome is a cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase (Tcr1963–5). To date, Helicobacter pylori is the only other sequenced organism that has solely a cbb3-type oxidase, and this has been proposed to be an adaptation to growth under microaerophilic conditions [49], since cbb3-type oxidase has a higher affinity for oxygen than aa3-type oxidase does [56].
S	SH58	PMID:17105352	A recent comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the cytochrome c553 proteins, including the mono-heme cytochromes from Thiom. crunogena and Thiob. denitrificans, revealed existence of a large protein superfamily that also includes proteins in the COG4654 cytochrome c551/c552 protein family (M. G. Klotz and A. B. Hooper, unpublished data). In ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, representatives of this protein superfamily (NE0102, Neut2204, and NmulA0344 in the COG4654 protein family; and Noc0751, NE0736, and Neut1650 in the COG2863 protein family) are the key electron carriers that connect the bc1 complex with complex IV as well as NOx-detoxifying reductases (i.e., NirK and NirS) and oxidases (i.e., cytochrome P460 and cytochrome c peroxidase) involved in nitrifier denitrification ([57] and references therein).
S	SH59	PMID:17105352	Unlike many other bacteria [67], the gene encoding the sole SulP-type ion transporter (Tcr1533) does not have a carbonic anhydrase gene adjacent to it.
S	SH61	PMID:17105352	The lack of CBB enzyme operons in obligate autotrophs from the Alpha-. Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, as well as the Cyanobacteria, may reflect a lack of selective pressure for these genes to be juxtaposed in their chromosomes for ease of coordinate repression during heterotrophic growth.
S	SH62	PMID:17105352	All of the genes necessary for an oxidative CAC are potentially present, as in some other obligate autotrophs and methanotrophs [18,78].
S	SH64	PMID:19197347	Free-living Epsilonproteobacteria have many genes containing diguanylate cyclase (GGDEF) and phosphodiesterase (EAL) domains, whereas Campylobacter and Helicobacter genomes have only a few or none.
S	SH65	PMID:19197347	At the time of writing, 22 out of 26 sequenced Epsilonproteobacteria have the luxS and pfs genes, with only four Campylobacter species lacking the AI-2 system. While LuxS has been shown to affect biofilm formation, motility, type III secretion, and the production of virulence factors and toxins in pathogens, it remains unclear whether AI-2 is truly a universal signal or simply a metabolic byproduct for most bacterial strains [43]–[45]. In support of the widespread nature of LuxS/Pfs in Epsilonproteobacteria, the metagenome of the A. pompejana episymbionts contains 36 luxS sequences and 49 pfs sequences [46]. The abundance of these genes in Epsilonproteobacteria at hydrothermal vents may offer a mechanism through which this group dominates episymbiont communities.
S	SH66	PMID:19197347	All the vent Epsilonproteobacteria as well as S. denitrificans and A. butzleri contain homologs to the second arsenate reductase (GAmH_0397 in N. profundicola). W. succinogenes, Sulfurovum, Nitratiruptor, and S. denitrificans contain an apparent operon that encodes an arsenite permease and regulatory protein, ArsR [18],[31],[61], whereas both N. profundicola and C. mediatlanticus lack an arsenical permease homolog (COG1055), but contain an arsR homolog (GAmH_0374) elsewhere.
S	SH67	PMID:19197347	There are several genes in N. profundicola and other vent Epsilonproteobacteria that encode proteins directly or peripherally involved in resistance to toxins. One of these is a member of the Nudix family of proteins that clean the cell of toxic nucleotide metabolites [56]. This gene (GAmH_1363) is predicted to encode ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase and is found only in the vent epsiloproteobacterial and Arcobacter butzleri genomes and not in pathogenic Epsilonproteobacteria [18],[57].
S	SH68	PMID:18790866	To determine how widely carboxydotrophy was distributed within the genus Thermococcus growing in hydrothermal vents, the presence of the CODH-encoding gene in seven Thermococcus species isolated from a solfataric acid field or hydrothermal vent was investigated. PCR products of CODH were not detected in any of the strains tested (data not shown). It is therefore suggested that CODH is restricted to only a few Thermococcus spp.
S	SH69	PMID:18790866	No F420-hydrogenase homologues from the Thermococcales have been reported, to our knowledge.
S	SH70	PMID:18790866	Unlike lithoheterotrophic bacteria at the ocean surface (22), T. onnurineus NA1 contains genes required for both CO oxidation and CO2 fixation, and a study of how the two processes can be coupled during CO oxidation is necessary.
S	SH71	PMID:32239454	Most species of Thermococcus have multi-copy [Ni-Fe] hydrogenases, which play an essential role in H2 production and energy converting respiration.
S	SH72	PMID:20975831	In the genomes of all obligate autotrophs including T. crunogena, RubisCO genes are not located near other enzymes of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle [12].
S	SH73	PMID:25279954	Thus, not only do the genomes of archaea and bacteria in vents encode a higher abundance of mobile elements, on average, than genomes native to other habitats, but vent viruses encode a high abundance of mobile elements as well.
S	SH74	PMID:29354879	These findings are consistent with previous studies that report hydrothermal Epsilonproteobacteria and nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospirae employing the rTCA cycle for CO2 fixation [51].
S	SH75	PMID:29354879	The results are in line with previous studies that reported WL pathway in acetogenic members, in autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria and archaea as well as in methanogenic Archaea [54, 55].
S	SH76	PMID:29354879	The 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3-HP/4-HB) cycle is mainly known to be conducted by autotrophic thermoacidophilic members of the Thaumarchaeota phylum [40].
S	SH77	PMID:29354879	The use of the reverse sulfate reduction pathway instead of the Sox pathway by hydrothermal Gammaproteobacteria has been previously reported [39, 61]
S	SH78	PMID:29354879	Members of the bacterial phyla Nitrospirae and Nitrospinae, mainly associated with RB dataset, were potentially involved in nitrite oxidation, as suggested by the presence of genes encoding enzymes involved in the nitrification process, namely narG and narH (Table S3)
S	SH79	PMID:29354879	In aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria, the same gene encodes for the particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) responsible for oxidizing ethane to methanol (see Methane metabolism section).
S	SH80	PMID:29354879	Genes encoding the Sox enzyme complex (soxABXYZ) for oxidation of thiosulfate (S2O32−) to elemental sulfur (S0) and the supplementary soxCD genes for the further oxidation of thiosulfate to sulfate (SO42−) were mainly found related to the epsilonproteobacterial genera Sulfurovum, Sulfurimonas, Arcobacter, and Nitratiruptor.
S	SH81	PMID:32561582	Interestingly, the genome of strain KV also encodes a putative multicopper oxidase, PcoAB, which could play a role in Fe(II) oxidation, a pathway found only in two other Zetaproteobacteria genomes (Ghiorsea bivora TAG-1 and SCGC AB-602-C20).
S	SH82	PMID:32561582	Both genomes contain the gene for form II ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCo) large subunit (cbbM), closely related to other Mariprofundus species cbbM genes (Fig. S2); cbbM is an essential gene for inorganic carbon fixation and is consistent with our growth observations in the laboratory (37).
S	SH83	PMID:32561582	Though the genomes contain the gene for form II RuBisCo, they do not contain the gene for form I RuBisCo (cbbL). This observation is consistent with findings in other Zetaproteobacteria, for example, strains CP-5, CP-8, EKF-M39, TAG-1, and SV-108 (21, 36, 40).
S	SH84	PMID:32561582	The genomes of many microaerophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria, originating from both freshwater and marine habitats, contain homologs of an outer membrane cytochrome protein (Cyc2) (42), which has been shown to oxidize Fe(II) in the acidophilic Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (43).
S	SH85	PMID:32561582	The presence of the alternative respiratory complex III (AC-III) is a common feature in many Zetaproteobacteria and other Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (36), and it has been hypothesized that they are able to use the AC-III, which is thought to be analogous to the bc1 complex, as well as a molybdopterin oxidoreductase (encoded by the actB gene) to facilitate Fe(II) oxidation (35).
S	SH86	PMID:32561582	Homologs of cbb3-type oxidases have been found in almost all Zetaproteobacteria genomes, aside from strains CP-5 and CP-8
S	SH87	PMID:26487573	Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase is the key enzyme of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, which may couple CO oxidation to sulfate reduction, or reduce CO2 to either acetate (acetogenesis) or methane (methanogenesis) (Wu et al., 2005; King and Weber, 2007). This pathway is previously reported in anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing Planctomycetes, sulfate-reducing bacteria and in autotrophic Archaeoglobales (Berg, 2011).
S	SH88	PMID:15164268	The key enzymes of CO metabolism are CO dehydrogenases, which perform the reaction CO + H2O→CO2 + 2e− + 2H+ (Meyer et al. 1993; Svetlitchny et al. 2001; Lindahl 2002). Among anaerobes, CO dehydrogenases are present in microorganisms that form or degrade acetate via the acetyl-CoA pathway found both in the representatives of Archaea and Bacteria domains. Among bacteria, it was found in acetogenic (Drake 1994), sulfate-reducing (see, e.g., Fukui et al. 1999) and some photosynthetic bacteria (Uffen 1983; Ensign 1995); and among archaea, in a variety of methanogens, including species of Methanosarcina, Methanothrix, and Methanocaldococcus (Ferry 1999), and in nonmethanogenic archaea like Archeoglobus fulgidus (Möller-Zinkhan and Thauer 1990) and Ferroglobus placidus (Vorholt et al. 1997).
S	SH89	PMID:15164268	The genus Thiomicrospira includes sulfide-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs possessing RubisCO form II (cbbM) in addition to form I (cbbL) (Tourova et al. 2006)
S	SH90	PMID:29521452	Chemolithoautotrophic bacteria from the genera Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira are common, sometimes dominant, isolates from sulfidic habitats including hydrothermal vents, soda and salt lakes and marine sediments. Their genome sequences confirm their membership in a deeply branching clade of the Gammaproteobacteria. Several adaptations to heterogeneous habitats are apparent. Their genomes include large numbers of genes for sensing and responding to their environment (EAL- and GGDEF-domain proteins and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins) despite their small sizes (2.1–3.1 Mbp).
S	SH91	PMID:29521452	Many members of Hydrogenovibrio and Thiomicrorhabdus have large tandem repeats preceding a gene encoding protein kinase (e.g., Tcr_0106; Fig. 2). Hydrogenovibrio halophilus lacks an ortholog to this protein kinase, as well as the repeated regions.
S	SH93	PMID:29521452	Genes with MCP domains are very abundant in members of Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira (11–23 genes per genome; Fig. 3), particularly when compared with other members of family Piscirickettsiaceae (0–13 genes per genome, median = 4).
S	SH94	PMID:29521452	As a result, several taxa carry multiple sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase genes, and this is also the case for other members of ‘Proteobacteria’ (Supporting Information Table S3).
S	SH95	PMID:29521452	Most of the members of Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira also carry one or multiple copies of flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase (SDH; EC 1.8.1.19; Table 3). These genomes encode a particularly large number of copies of this enzyme (up to 4); other members of ‘Proteobacteria’ typically carry fewer (1–2; Supporting Information Table S3).
S	SH96	PMID:29521452	Members of the genera Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira carry genes encoding the complete thiosulfate-oxidizing multienzyme system (‘Sox complex’, encoded by soxABCDXYZ) associated with the Kelly–Friedrich pathway, which can oxidize thiosulfate completely to sulfate without the formation of any free intermediates in the cell or locale. These genes are not collocated in a single operon, similar to H. crunogenus (Scott et al., 2006), suggesting that they may be differentially regulated. Most of the the ‘Proteobacteria’ surveyed here carry soxABXYZ instead (Supporting Information Table S3); this ‘incomplete’ Sox complex may produce polysulfide or elemental sulfur (Frigaard and Dahl, 2009).
S	SH97	PMID:29521452	As has been noted for H. crunogenus (Scott et al., 2006), members of Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira lack dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DSR); this enzyme is common in photosynthetic sulfur oxidizing bacteria, which use it to oxidize sulfide and elemental sulfur to sulfite (Frigaard and Dahl, 2009). This complex is also encoded in the genomes of many chemolithoautotrophic members of ‘Proteobacteria’ (Supporting Information Table S3). Its absence in Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira is consistent with previous studies which noted that the DSR complex is absent from organisms carrying genes encoding a complete Sox complex that includes SoxCD (Frigaard and Dahl, 2009; Gregersen et al., 2011). Genes encoding enzymes to oxidize sulfite directly (SorAB, SoeABC) or indirectly (dissimilatory APS reductase) are also absent from their genomes, though these genes are common among other ‘Proteobacteria’ (Supporting Information Table S3).
S	SH98	PMID:29521452	All of them also carry genes encoding NDH-1-type NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (NADH dehydrogenase, EC 1.6.5.3), cytochrome bc1 complex (EC 1.10.2.2) and a cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1), which facilitates growth under low oxygen conditions (Pitcher and Watmough, 2004) and has been purified and characterized from Tms. aerophila (Sorokin et al., 1999).
S	SH99	PMID:29521452	Genes encoding group 1d (oxygen-tolerant) and 2b (sensory) hydrogenases are present in both H. marinus and H. thermophilus MA2–6, and both are capable of growth with hydrogen gas as the electron donor (Hansen and Perner, 2016). Genes encoding group 1d hydrogenase are common among the members of Gammaproteobacteria (Supporting Information Table S4).
S	SH100	PMID:29521452	Two, and often three, genes encoding RubisCO are present in genomes from members of Hydrogenovibrio and Thiomicrorhabdus (Table 4); it is more common among ‘Proteobacteria’ for genomes to include one or two of these genes (Supporting Information Table S5).
S	SH101	PMID:29521452	Genomes of most members of Thiomicrospira encode only carboxysomal RubisCO (form IAc) and not form II (Table 4), confirming results from PCR-based assays for these enzymes (Tourova et al., 2006).
S	SH102	PMID:21410492	Closer examination of this trend shows that thermophilic strains, on average, have higher numbers of CRISPR loci in their genomes than mesophiles.
