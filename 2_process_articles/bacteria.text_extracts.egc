S	S1	PMID:19805210	copiotrophs are enriched in COGs involved in motility (N), defense mechanisms (V), transcription (K), and signal transduction (T)
S	S2	PMID:19805210	Consistent with predictions by Poindexter (14) that copiotrophic bacteria are likely to display an extensive range of cellular responses to environmental stimuli, regulators with FOG:GGDEF domains (COG2199) and FOG:EAL domains (COG2200) are more abundant in copiotrophs.
S	S3	PMID:19805210	Copiotrophic genomes also contain significantly more acetyltransferases of the isoleucine patch superfamily (COG0110).
S	S4	PMID:19805210	oligotrophs are enriched in COGs for lipid transport and metabolism (I) and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism (Q).
S	S5	PMID:19805210	A large array of gene families involved in the degradation of fatty acids is consistently overrepresented in oligotroph genomes, including COG0183 (acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase), COG0318 (acyl-CoA synthetases (AMP-forming)/AMP-acid ligases II), COG1024 (enoyl-CoA hydratase/carnithine racemase), COG1804 (acyl-CoA transferase/carnitine dehydratase), and COG1960 (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase).
S	S6	PMID:19805210	Similarly, the oligotroph genome dataset consistently has a high number of genes within COG0625 (GST) that are involved in detoxification reactions, the degradation of xenobiotic compounds, and the catabolism of recalcitrant compounds for carbon and energy, and other gene groups (COG0179, COG1680, COG3485) involved in the degradation of several aromatic substrates including β-lactamic compounds, tyrosine, and catechol.
S	S7	PMID:19805210	Copiotroph genomes also contain more repeats within clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs).
S	S8	PMID:19805210	The Planctomycetes are characterized by interesting genomic traits, having a single copy of the rRNA operon (a feature of oligotrophs), while also possessing large genomes (a feature of copiotrophs).
S	S9	PMID:19805210	Specific clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) that were consistently overrepresented in copiotrophs included components of phosphotransferase systems (PTS) that are central for regulation and transport of sugars (COG1263, COG1299), Na+ transporters (COG0733), and a wide array of other highly specific transporters (COG0697, COG1292, COG2116, COG2704) and permeases (COG0697, COG0814, COG1114, COG1275, COG1972, COG2271, COG3104).
S	S10	PMID:19805210	The genomic analysis showed an overrepresentation across all copiotrophic datasets of enzymes such as chitinases (COG3325) and collagenases (COG0826).
S	S11	PMID:19805210	genomes of copiotrophs are overrepresented in highly efficient dissimilatory selenocysteine-containing dehydrogenases (COG0243), and to a lesser extent, components of alternative electron transport chains including COG0716 (flavodoxins), COG2863 (cytochrome c553), and COG3005 (nitrate/trimethylamine N-oxide reductases, membrane-bound tetraheme cytochrome c subunit).
S	S12	PMID:19805210	The capacity of copiotrophs to rapidly and tightly regulate metabolism and use energetically expensive transporters for nutrient acquisition is consistent with the presence of a high proportion of COGs related to transcription and signal transduction. A particularly strong bias is evident for COG0583 (transcriptional regulator), COG2207 (AraC-type DNA-binding domain-containing proteins), and COG3710 [DNA-binding winged-helix–turn–helix (HTH) domains].
S	S13	PMID:19805210	In addition to catabolic genes, genes involved in fatty acids biosynthesis are overrepresented in oligotrophs; i.e., most of the genes belonging to COG1028 are dehydrogenases with different specificities for short-chain alcohols.
S	S14	PMID:19805210	In addition, cytochrome P450 genes (COG2124) are present in S. alaskensis RB2256 (six copies) and absent in P. angustum S14, and the high frequency by which these genes occur is a conserved feature of oligotroph genomes.
S	S15	PMID:19805210	This included an absence of the hrc genes, which encode the injectisome (Wagner et al., 2018), and the hrp genes, which are essential to suppress host plant defense responses for Xanthomonas species
S	S16	PMID:32983016	The assessment of 133 pathogenicity-related genes identified that the three Xanthomonas strains (GW, SS and SI) was devoid of the T3SS that is critical for pathogenicity of most Xanthomonas species
S	S18	PMID:29225728	Interestingly, the vast majority of anaerobic prokaryotes appear to possess either an Ech or Rnf but not both
S	S19	PMID:29225728	a recent analysis of rumen prokaryotic genomes identified Butyrivibrio and Pseudobutyrivibrio as a rare group of bacteria that possess genes for both Ech and Rnf
S	S20	PMID:22965120	The presence of PPE gene family is unique to mycobacteria among prokaryotes
S	S21	PMID:22965120	The prevalence of ‘Hr’ proteins strongly suggests the preference of MIP to inhabit water-columns or sediments, where they reside predominantly at oxic–anoxic interface (OAI) and in the anoxic regions of the marine habitat or both as reported in the case of magnetotactic bacteria, which are also endowed with the abundance of hemerythrins ( 62 ).
S	S22	PMID:22965120	Notably, thiocyanate gene cluster is absent from all the pathogenic mycobacteria analyzed in this study (including M. abscessus and the opportunists of MAC ).
S	S23	PMID:22965120	Thus, despite having PE-PPE genes and mce1 operon, which enable mycobacteria to invade the host cell, MIP lacks both mce2 and mce3 operons, which are essential for causing macrophage infections by M. tuberculosi s and M. avium
S	S24	PMID:19617360	As in the case of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 and other chemolithoautotrophic representatives, an incomplete tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was detected, in which genes for the 2-oxogluatarate dehydrogenase enzyme complex were absent.
S	S25	PMID:15317790	Further support of SpoT functionality is the high level of conservation of the genes among the Rickettsia species.
S	S26	PMID:15317790	As in the other rickettsiae, the 16S rRNA gene was separated from the 23S and 5S rRNA genes.
S	S27	PMID:15317790	Rickettsial organisms have comparatively small genomes (1.1 to 1.3 Mb) that have arisen through reductive evolution as they developed dependence on the host cell for necessary functions (6). As a result, their genomes are littered with pseudogenes.
S	S28	PMID:15317790	Two other possible resistance genes, the acriflavin resistance gene (acrD, RT0161) and a tellurite resistance gene (terC, RT0774) were found in the R. typhi genome. These two genes are also present in R. prowazekii and R. conorii
S	S29	PMID:19617360	In addition, genes for sulfur and reduced inorganic sulfur compound oxidation were identified, including two gene clusters harboring the genes encoding the sulfur oxidation complex SOX (soxYZB-hyp-resB-soxAX-resC and soxYZA-hyp-SoxB), previously characterized in neutrophilic, chemoautotrophic bacteria (9); genes for the sulfur quinone oxidoreductase enzyme (sqr); a sulfur oxygenase:reductase gene (sor); and genes for a tetrathionate hydrolase and a thiosulfate quinone oxidoreductase (doxD) previously characterized in this strain (18).
S	S30	PMID:19136599	What seems more diagnostic of the Aquificales is their ability to oxidize sulfur, and all genomes have a suite of sox genes and a sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (sqr), which catalyzes the oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur.
S	S31	PMID:25211235	It also has the hpn genes (hpnHNKJI, MOC_1185, MOC_1187 and MOC_1189 to MOC_1191) encoding hopanoid biosynthesis proteins. Hopanoids are pentacyclic compounds that are similar to eukaryotic cholesterol in terms of their structure and function. Indeed, there is a report on the production of hopanoids by Methylobacterium [63].
S	S32	PMID:25211235	Methylotrophs are of polyphyletic origin [113], and the mxa gene cluster which is one of the major methylotrophy gene clusters is highly conserved among methylotrophs, including M. oryzae, that even belong to the Gamma- or Betaproteobacteria.
S	S34	PMID:20828392	Indeed, G. bemidjiensis and the other genomes of subsurface Geobacter species possess a very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (fadE Gbem_2128) 50% identical to that of Bacillus subtilis[16], which is absent from G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens.
S	S35	PMID:20828392	Most Geobacteraceae, which do not utilize glucose and galactose, possess only a putative glucose 6-kinase (Gbem_1326) similar to those of Streptomyces lividans and Streptomyces coelicolor[32, 33], a UDP-glucose/galactose 4-epimerase (Gbem_3215) and a different putative galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase.
S	S36	PMID:20828392	All Geobacteraceae encode at least one iron-sulfur-oxygen hybrid cluster protein, thought to detoxify an unidentified reactive compound in response to nitric oxide stress [57], as well as hydrogen peroxide stress [58]; G. bemidjiensis and Geobacter sp. M21 alone have three hybrid cluster protein genes (Gbem_1033, Gbem_1168, Gbem_1239), evidently derived by expansion of a single ancestral gene.
S	S37	PMID:28234349	Another group of conserved virulence factors, which show distinct patterns of evolution within the three major lineages of Bartonellae are hemin-binding proteins (Hbp).
S	S38	PMID:23190728	The most striking proteomic difference between predators and non-predators is in their method of synthesizing isoprenoids: all predators except M. aeruginosavorus encode genes coding for the mevalonate pathway but lack genes coding for the non-mevalonate (also known as the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate or DOXP) pathway, whereas the opposite is true for the non-predators.
S	S39	PMID:23190728	Another significant difference is found in the use of an archeal-eukaryotic GlyRS α2 dimer uncommon in Bacteria (Woese et al., 2000; Wolf et al., 1999), by all obligate and almost all facultative predators instead of the more frequent α2/β2 tetramer composed of two different subunits in non-predators.
S	S40	PMID:23190728	Accordingly, enzymes forming the DOXP pathway, which is used by plants, apicomplexan protozoa and most bacteria, are conspicuously absent from almost all predators and were detected as enriched for in non-predators.
S	S41	PMID:22717884	Comparative genome analysis revealed that GTA-like structures are widespread among genomes of organisms affiliated with the Rhodobacterales (Lang and Beatty, 2007).
S	S42	PMID:22717884	PFAM (protein family) motifs were identified in several of the proteins that are present in the dlt operon of Gram-positive bacteria (Glaser, 1995).
S	S43	PMID:22717884	The dltA genes are part of a larger cluster of 19 Phaeobacter unique genes (PGA1_c13610-PGA1_c13830 in DSM 17395).
S	S44	PMID:22717884	These ORFs share homology with the metH gene of Escherichia coli and with the S. meliloti betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase gene bmt, which represents a link between methionine biosynthesis and glycine betaine degradation in this organism (Barra et al., 2006).
S	S45	PMID:22717884	The Phaeobacter ORFs have only one-third of the size of metH and lack the cobalamin binding, the activation and the pterin-binding domains. Nevertheless, the vitamin B12-binding domains are encoded in ORFs (PGA1_c13350/PGA2_c13290) in the vicinity. The activation domain might be substituted by PGA1_c13360 (PGA2_c13300) that encodes a radical SAM domain (PF04055), which is thought to catalyze unusual methylation reactions (Sofia et al., 2001). Together, these three ORFs might code for enzymes that substitute both MetH, known from E. coli, and Bmt from S. meliloti. These genes and their arrangement are also present in other Roseobacter species
S	S46	PMID:29040502	In agreement with this, we found genes encoding the dissimilatory sulfite reductase, dsrAB, in the genomes of all desulfitobacteria, except D. metallireducens.
S	S47	PMID:29040502	Four to 23 putative OdmA encoding genes have been reported in D. hafniense, D. dehalogenans and D. dichloroeliminans, and none in D. metallireducens (Nonaka et al.2006; Kim et al.2012; Mingo, Studenik and Diekert 2014) (Fig. S6, Supporting Information; Table 3). Their occurrence in nearly all Desulfitobacterium spp. genomes suggests that O-methylated compounds are important electron donors for Desulfitobacterium spp.The predicted OdmA (Dhaf_4611) from D. hafniense DCB-2T has been heterologously expressed and demonstrated to be a functional O-demethylase showing highest specific activity towards guaiacol and methyl chloride (Fig. S6) (Studenik, Vogel and Diekert 2012). Another odmA paralog (DSY3155) was found to be highly upregulated when D. hafniense Y51 was grown with vanillate as electron donor (Fig. S6) (Peng et al.2011).
S	S48	PMID:29040502	A cytoplasmic membrane-bound Ni-Fe hydrogenase (Hyf), found in all Desulfitobacterium spp., consists of six subunits, four of which are membrane integral. The corresponding gene cluster resembles the hyfBCEFGI components of the formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) 4 complex-encoding gene cluster (hyfABCDEFGHIR-focB) described for E. coli
S	S50	PMID:29040502	We found that all analyzed genomes from Desulfitobacterium spp. encode intact cobalamin synthesis pathways, indicating that this is a general trait of this genus (Table 3). The synthesis pathway is organized similarly in all analyzed desulfitobacteria. It consists of three clusters (I–III) located separately in the genomes (Fig. 5). Cluster I encodes the proteins needed for synthesis of the basic ring structure from glutamyl-tRNA to sirohydrochlorin (also called factor II); cluster II encodes the steps starting from cobalt insertion until adenosyl cobinamide; and finally cluster III encodes all proteins needed for insertion of the lower ligand leading to cobalamin, with the exception of cobC that is located elsewhere in the genome
S	S51	PMID:29040502	All analyzed genomes of Desulfitobacterium spp. with the exception of D. dichloroeliminans encode one copy of the menFDHCEBIAG MK synthesis pathway
S	S52	PMID:29530765	Bacteria have evolved to adapt to temperature downshift primarily through the production of nucleic acid chaperons known as cold-shock proteins (Csps) [42]. Genome analysis of ERDD5:01 showed occurrence of multiple copies of genes encoding for cold active chaperons and cold-shock inducible proteins (CspD, ClpB, GroEL, GroES, HscA/HscB, Hsp33, SurA, FliS, SecB, HtpG) (Table 2). Presence of such genes for Csps in higher copy number has been observed in other psychrotrophic bacteria such as Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis; Arthrobacter sp., and Bacillus psychrophilus
S	S53	PMID:17579514	The two most prominently represented COG categories in each of the gut-associated Bacteroidetes proteomes are G (carbohydrate transport and metabolism) and M (cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis). The two most prominent COG categories in their shared proteome are E (amino acid transport and metabolism) and J (translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis)
S	S54	PMID:15984913	Besides long repeats, Rickettsia genomes are known to contain a number of small palindromic repeats (Rickettsia palindromic elements [RPEs]) capable of invading both coding and noncoding regions [16].
S	S55	PMID:15984913	The genomes of five Rickettsia species (R. prowazekii, R. typhi, R. conorii, R. sibirica, and R. felis) exhibit chromosomal patatin-like phospholipase gene (pat1). Gene organization around pat1 is similar between these Rickettsia.
S	S56	PMID:15984913	The sca family is one of the largest paralogous gene families in Rickettsia [8].
S	S57	PMID:15984913	Only ompB and sca4 are conserved in all available Rickettsia genomes [19], remaining members being degraded or absent in one or more species.
S	S58	PMID:15984913	The toxin–antitoxin modules have also been found on the chromosomes of many free-living prokaryotes, but have rarely been found in obligate intracellular bacteria
S	S61	PMID:15984913	Among other bacteria, only A. tumefasciens, Thermotoga maritima, and Sinorhizobium melitoti were found to exhibit HEPN-containing genes
S	S62	PMID:15984913	Two R. felis–specific ORFs (RF0449 and RF0855) exhibit the complete NACHT NTPase domain. In eukaryotes, this NTPase domain has been found in proteins implicated in apoptosis as well as in immune/inflammatory responses [38]. The presence of this domain in other bacterial ORFs is limited to several lineages, such as cyanobacteria and Streptomyces, and their functions are unknown.
S	S63	PMID:15984913	Altogether, flea-infecting bacteria appear to exhibit a specific evolution (i.e., more repeats, transposases, and/or integrases) compared with their non-flea-infecting neighbors.
S	S64	PMID:19893622	The low number of core rdhAB, contrasted with the high rdhAB numbers per genome (up to 36 in strain VS), as well as their colocalization with GEIs and other signatures for horizontal transfer, suggests that niche adaptation via organohalide respiration is a fundamental ecological strategy in Dehalococccoides.
S	S65	PMID:19283063	The L. hongkongensis genome lacks a complete set of enzymes for glycolysis, with orthologues of glucokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase being absent (Table S1). This is compatible with its asaccharolytic phenotype and is consistent with other asaccharolytic bacteria, such as Campylobacter jejuni, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica, in that glucokinase and 6-phosphofructokinase are also absent from their genomes [18],[19].
S	S66	PMID:19283063	Enteric bacteria use several quorum-sensing mechanisms, including the LuxR-I, LuxS/AI-2, and AI-3/epinephrine/norepinephrine systems, to recognize the host environment and communicate across species. Unlike the genomes of C. violaceum and the pathogenic Neisseria species which encode genes involved in LuxR-I and LuxS/AI-2 systems respectively, the L. hongkongensis genome does not encode genes of these 2 systems.
S	S67	PMID:19283063	aidA and tibA encode proteins of the autotransporter family, type V protein secretion system of Gram-negative bacteria.
S	S68	PMID:32661122	Indeed, a repeating theme in the Enterobacteriaceae family is the use of AcrAB, found in Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Klebsiella, and other pathogens, to resist both bile salts (24) and antibiotics (30, 31), thereby making it essential for survival under extreme environmental conditions.
S	S69	PMID:32661122	S. aureus encodes several efflux pumps, including NorA, NorB, NorC, and Tet38, that confer resistance to quinolones and tetracyclines (78).
S	S70	PMID:32661122	(S. aureus) Finally, methicillin resistance is mediated through the mecA gene that encodes a penicillin binding protein to resist β-lactam antibiotics (81).
S	S71	PMID:32661122	Finally, antibiotic resistance in K. pneumoniae is further facilitated by multiple efflux pumps, including AcrAB and KexD of the RND family, KdeA of the MATE family, and KmrA of the MFS family (96–99)
S	S72	PMID:16169927	In the same way, the number of tRNA genes is quite high (106 genes), a feature in common with that in vibrios and in Photobacterium profundum (Table 1). These genes are organized in long runs of repeated sequences. The longest contains 19 tRNA genes in a row, seven of which coding for an identical tRNAglu (TTC anticodon), suggesting a slipped mispair mechanism of expansion in situations of rapid growth.
S	S73	PMID:16169927	The pattern of amino acid distribution in γ-proteobacteria from different biotopes (Supplemental Fig. 3) displays an overall trend similar in the various genomes of interest, with leucine (L) being most abundant, while tryptophan (W), cysteine (C), histidine (H), and to a lesser extent methionine (M) are used infrequently. The proteome of the thermophilic genomes looks significantly different from that of the mesophilic and psychrophilic counterparts (strong avoidance of glutamine [Q] in thermophilic species, preference for alanine [A] in mesophilic and psychrophilic species, except in Oceanobacillus iheyensis).
S	S74	PMID:16169927	The most unexpected feature of the genome is the prominent absence of a RNA/nucleoid-associated cold-shock gene ubiquitous in γ-proteobacteria, hns.
S	S75	PMID:16169927	The existence of a complete set of genes (including hns) was also observed in other marine and cold-adapted bacteria, including S. oneidensis (Heidelberg et al. 2002) and D. psychrophila (Rabus et al. 2004).
S	S76	PMID:16169927	As in vibrios, phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (ppsA) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (ppc) genes are located in chrII. However, ppsA is located in chrI in P. profundum.
S	S77	PMID:16169927	The MtnN(Pfs)/LuxS pathway leads to synthesis of the quorum sensing (QS) effector autoinducer-2 (AI-2). Xanthomonadales and Pseudomonadales aside, all γ-proteobacteria sequenced use that pathway.
S	S80	PMID:25685259	Notably, two genes have been found to show high similarity with attC and attG genes from Agrobacterium, whose mutation leads to lack of attachment on tomato, carrot, and Bryophyllum daigremontiana
S	S81	PMID:27351589	All de novo assembled complete B. pumilus genomes shows absolute conservation of gene order in the region immediately downstream of the replication origin, between dnaA and metS (metG) genes.
S	S82	PMID:23749977	Plasmid compatibility of the segmented Borrelia genome involves orthologous sets of proteins, one of which, designated Pfam32, is homologous to ParA, a plasmid partitioning protein found in other bacteria (14–16). Other Borrelia plasmid-encoded proteins of these sets, such as Pfam49, appear to be unique to this genus, are widely distributed on both linear and circular replicons, and presumably are also involved in replication and compatibility.
S	S83	PMID:23749977	The longer length of B. hermsii block I relative to B. turicatae block I is attributable to a higher number of repeated “P35” (Pfam54) homologs, a family of lipoproteins in LD Borrelia species (52).
S	S84	PMID:23749977	Our inference about a common ancestry for the large linear plasmids of RF Borrelia species was anticipated by prior findings of the nrdEFI genes on large plasmids across species
S	S85	PMID:23749977	The lp54 plasmids bear genes whose expression is regulated during the infectious cycle and that in their respective presence or absence distinguish LD species from RF species. These include OspA (bba15) and OspB (bba16) (69, 70) and DbpA (bba24) and DbpB (bba25) (71). GC skew analysis indicates that the ospAB and dbpAB operons were acquired horizontally by the LD lineage after the putative split from the lineage leading to RF species.
S	S86	PMID:27684472	MompS is a Legionella cell surface virulence factor important for adherence [60] and entry [61] into phagocytes, and it is one of 7 genes included in the international sequence-based typing (SBT) scheme. This momp gene complement and structural organization is conserved in all additional ST36 strains sequenced in the present study, as well as in all Legionella reference genomes examined (data not shown).
S	S87	PMID:19775431	We also searched for exclusively conserved CDS between GDI and Azoarcus sp. BH72, as these two bacteria are currently the only diazotrophs among the endophytes sequenced. The result confirmed the presence in both endophytes of the nif cluster (figure 2, around 0.5 MB) and genes from the putative gum cluster are only conserved within Azoarcus sp. BH72 and GDI (Additional file 10).
S	S89	PMID:19775431	An unusual observation is the presence in the GDI genome of two copies of the chaperonin genes groES (GDI2050, GDI2648) and groEL (GDI2049, GDI2647), which are usually present as single copy in bacteria.
S	S90	PMID:19775431	Oxidation steps of ent-kaurene, necessary to produce GA1 and GA3, may be catalyzed by two cytochromes P450 (GDI2364 and GDI2593), homologs of which are absent in other acetobacteraceae genomes, thus suggesting a likely specific role in G. diazotrophicus.
S	S93	PMID:19775431	Another difference is that, in Agrobacterium tumefasciens and Enterobacter IncP plasmid R751, the first gene in the operon is traI, which is an essential signal for the quorum-sensing regulation of the Ti plasmid conjugation transfer
S	S94	PMID:19775431	Next to the motility cluster there is a putative tad locus (Flp-1, cpaABC, cpaEF, and tadBCDG) which probably encodes the machinery for the synthesis of Flp (fimbrial low-molecular-weight protein) pili, which form a subfamily in the type IVb pilus family. In Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Pasteurella, Pseudomonas, Yersinia and Caulobacter. Flp pili are essential for biofilm formation, colonization and pathogenesis [68].
S	S95	PMID:19775431	Finally, comparison of genome sequences of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus and Azoarcus sp. BH72 shows that these endophytic diazotrophic bacteria adopted very different strategies to colonize plants. A limited number of genomic features, such as the large number of TonB receptors, the gum-like and nif clusters, and osmotolerance mechanisms are common to both endophytic diazotrophic bacteria.
S	S97	PMID:26769932	Although the majority of AOB genomes contain nirK (15), the gene for the copper-containing nitrite reductase, no homologues were found in N. communis for either nirK or the cytochrome cd1 nirS nitrite reductases; however, a recent study showed that NirK is not required for nitrifier denitrification in N. europaea (16).
S	S98	PMID:25798594	Five other non-coding RNA sequences have been identified in the K78 genome, the RNA subunit of RNase P (rnpB) (Rfam family RF00010), the small signal recognition particle RNA (ffs) (RF00169), a transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) (RF00023) and analogs to dsrA and ssrS (6S RNA). In B. burgdorferi, dsrA has been shown to be involved in translational regulation of RpoS [71], ssrS binds to the RNA polymerase holoenzyme and regulates gene expression at the shift from exponential growth to stationary phase [72]. The genes ffs, dsrA and ssrS have previously not been annotated in any of the complete genomes of the different Borrelia species.
S	S99	PMID:25798594	Borrelia genomes contain an exceptional high number of lipoproteins.
S	S100	PMID:25798594	Many genes located on the conserved lp54 plasmid have low sequence identity across Borrelia species, among them are the genes encoding decorin binding proteins A and B (dbpA and dbpB, Pfam74) and the complement regulator-acquiring surface protein 1, CRASP-1, paralogous family 54 (Pfam54).
S	S101	PMID:25798594	Even though multiple insertions and deletions occur at this location, the overall gene structure of the cp26 plasmids is highly conserved across Borrelia species, underlining the high importance of cp26.
S	S103	PMID:25798594	Proteins with KID-repeats (IPR003900) are found on the cp32 and lp28 type plasmids of K78. These repeats contain the tripeptides KID and/or KIE, and are characteristic of the Bdr family (Pfam80), which are inner membrane proteins unique to Borrelia.
S	S104	PMID:25798594	The membrane lipoprotein VlsE is part of the immune escape mechanisms of Borrelia.
S	S105	PMID:22448227	For example, the genome contained genes involved in oxidization of inorganic sulfur (SOX genes, Fig. 7). Sulfur oxidization pathways are also present in Cupriavidus and Ralstonia strains (e.g. [25]).
S	S106	PMID:22448227	By contrast, most genomes of Cupriavidus and Ralstonia strains encode putative transporters for carbohydrates.
S	S107	PMID:22448227	The genome encoded two catalase genes (Pnuc_2044, Pnuc_2053) and two superoxide dismutase genes (Pnuc_1385, Pnuc_1626). In both cases, one of the isoenzymes is putatively exported while the other seems to be a cytoplasmic enzyme. The two encoded superoxide dismutases represent one enzyme of the Fe/Mn and one of the Cu/Zn type. The presence of both two catalase and two superoxide dismutase genes in one genome is not unusual among Betaproteobacteria.
S	S108	PMID:22448227	In addition, a glycolate permease gene as found in Ralstonia/Cupriavidus strains is missing in QLW-P1DMWA-1.
S	S109	PMID:22448227	The genome shares several characteristics with genomes of marine oligotrophs [46]. This includes, for instance, the presence of only a single ribosomal operon, and underrepresentation of genes assigned to the COG categories N (cell motility and secretion), T (signal transduction), V (defense), and K (transcription). An overrepresentation of categories Q (secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism) and I (lipid transport and metabolism), however, was not observed (data not shown).
S	S110	PMID:22448227	Furthermore, the commonly relatively low G+C content of Polynucleobacter genomes (<50 mol% vs. >60 mol% for the majority of other Burkholderiaceae) as well as previous estimations of genome sizes [7] suggest that reduced genome sizes represent a common feature of Polynucleobacter bacteria.
S	S111	PMID:26301592	Comparing to other Cupriavidus strains, we find that czc, pbr, chr, cus genetic resistance determinants are common in all Cupriavidus bacteria.
S	S112	PMID:24324632	It should be noted that in our analysis we did not include members of the Chlamydieae and Planctomycetes lineages, which do not possess ftsZ but may use other methods to produce a peptidoglycan septum
S	S113	PMID:24324632	Like other Anaplasmataceae, Ca. X. pacificiensis lacks a functional LPS biosynthetic pathway [37] (see Fig. 14), but unlike the majority of this family, it maintains many genes involved in flagellar assembly [54].
S	S114	PMID:24324632	For instance, although most Ehrlichia do not possess flagellar assembly genes, they have been shown to play a role in the growth of another intracellular pathogen, Legionella pneumophila
S	S115	PMID:24324632	The genes in this apparatus (see Fig. 14) are in line with other members of the Anaplasmataceae, which commonly lack homologs of virB1, virB2, virB5 and virB7
S	S116	PMID:30665414	As with all Anaplasma (Rickettsiales) species reported to date, A. ovis contains a single split operon encoding the ribosomal RNA genes, with 23S and 5S genes being transcribed as one polycistron and the 16S gene being transcribed separately.
S	S117	PMID:30665414	VirB1 and VirB5 have not been identified for any Anaplasmaceae
S	S119	PMID:17540897	Synthesis of the Nod-factor chitin oligomer backbone requires the activity of three specific enzymes, encoded by the nodABC genes, which are present in all rhizobia characterized thus far.
S	S120	PMID:17540897	According to their host specificity within different species of Aeschynomene, two groups of photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium have been described (8): Group I strains contain the common nodulation genes nodABC and form nodules on all stem-nodulating Aeschynomene species (9), whereas nodulation ability in group II strains is restricted to a few species, including A. sensitiva and A. indica. The nod genes have not been detected in group II strains.
S	S121	PMID:17540897	Most of the 1343 genes in common were homogeneously distributed on the genomes (Fig. 1), except for genes involved in photosynthesis, which were clustered in a 50-kb region. This region, designated the photosynthesis gene cluster (PGC), is common in purple photosynthetic bacteria.
S	S122	PMID:18192393	High-G+C-content gram-positive coryneform bacteria cause economic losses in several crops worldwide, yet the relatively slow in vitro and in planta growth and general genetic intractability of these bacteria have long been deterrents to successful identification of the specific molecular mechanisms by which they cause diseases in plants.
S	S123	PMID:18192393	The relatively high chromosomal G+C content is typical of free-living actinomycetes, as is the slightly lower G+C content of the plasmids.
S	S124	PMID:18375554	However, several redundant enzymes that are present in these pathways in E. coli are missing in P. mirabilis, including fumAB, tktB, talA, pfkB, and gpmI.
S	S125	PMID:26061173	One of the plasmids in Ac-8003, pAcX50c, belongs to the IncP-1 incompatability group and the genomic analysis shows it contains tra and trb gene clusters found in the IncP1-γ family of plasmids from Pseudomonads.
S	S127	PMID:21738717	Upregulation of genes encoding the cytochrome bd oxidase (PPA0175, cydB, PPA0176, cydA), a respiratory endoxidase, which, in Escherichia coli, favors survival under low oxygen tensions [31], was detected in the EP.
S	S130	PMID:21738717	OsmC-family proteins apparently function as peroxiredoxins [37]. PPA0581 encodes a protein with homology to Hsp31 of E. coli, which has chaperone activity [38].
S	S131	PMID:21738717	HicB is part of a cluster, HicAB, which is predicted to be a RNA-targeting toxin-antitoxin (TA) system present in a variety of bacteria [39]; hicAB transcription in E. coli was shown to be strongly induced by nutrient starvation
S	S132	PMID:20023012	The core proteins, the cas1 and cas2 genes, and a csn1 gene formed the CRISPR subtype Nmeni, which is associated with vertebrate pathogens and commensals
S	S133	PMID:20023012	However, the lack of typical pathogenic type I or III secretion systems such as the hec cluster of Dickeya chrysanthemi (15) or the inv/spa system of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (13) indicated that TPSY would probably not exhibit a pathogenic lifestyle.
S	S134	PMID:26900859	We found that several Pfam clans such as protein kinase domain [CL0016], PP-binding (CL0314), PKinase (CL0016), CoA-acyltrans (CL0149), Peptidase_PA (CL0124), GroES (CL0296), AB_hydrolase (CL0028), Thiolase (CL0046), CheY (CL0304), AMP-binding_C (CL0531), HTH (CL0123) etc. are overrepresented in order Myxococcales members by more than 200% as compared to non-Myxococcales δ-proteobacteria.
S	S135	PMID:26900859	Besides this, many Pfam clans such as EGF (CL0001), Trefoil (CL0066), gCrystallin (CL0333), Aerolisin_ETX (CL0345), Hydrophilin (CL0385), Viral_Gag (CL0148), zf-FYVE-PHD (CL0390), HMG-box (CL0114), PLAT (CL0321), EsxAB (CL0352), Frag1-like (CL0412), Hexosaminidase (CL0546) etc. are particularly present in genus Myxococcus members and not in the non-Myxococcales δ-proteobacteria.
S	S136	PMID:18350144	As reported in A. baylyi str. ADP1 [9], the central metabolism study of both A. baumannii strains confirms the lack of several key enzymes: a glucokinase, proteins of a phosphotransferase transport system, a 6-phosphofructokinase and a pyruvate kinase. The latter activity which exists in Pseudomonas spp. seems to be a good marker to clearly delineate both genera. Few Acinetobacter isolates are able to grow on glucose as sole carbon source and this property was early used as a main criterion to classify Acinetobacter species [32]. The Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas glycolysis can certainly not be performed in Acinetobacter spp. given the lack of the previously mentioned enzymes.
S	S139	PMID:18350144	These findings suggest that OmpA proteins are ubiquitous in the Acinetobacter genus but also raise questions on their exact role.
S	S141	PMID:20023027	For example, “Ca. Amoebophilus asiaticus” has no pathways for cofactor biosynthesis and misses the genetic repertoire for the generation of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, a feature shared with rickettsiae and chlamydiae
S	S142	PMID:20023027	For this, “Ca. Amoebophilus asiaticus” might employ a mechanism similar to that of rickettsiae, since its genome encodes two putative phospholipases D (Aasi_0130 and Aasi_0227) with a high similarity (approximately 40% amino acid sequence identity) to the functionally characterized phospholipase D from Rickettsia spp., which is considered the major effector for vacuole exit
S	S143	PMID:20023027	Some other bacteria also encode ANK proteins but generally at much lower numbers (below 10 ANK proteins per genome) (30, 90, 128). Interestingly, those bacterial genomes with the highest numbers of ANK proteins are from intracellular bacteria (Fig. 2; see also Table S7 in the supplemental material), suggesting that this group of proteins plays a role in the interaction with eukaryotic cells.
S	S144	PMID:9634230	Many are clustered, suggesting the existence of insertional hot-spots that prevent genes from being inactivated, as has been described for Rhizobium
S	S145	PMID:9634230	At least two discrete types of enzyme system, fatty acid synthase (FAS) I and FAS II, are involved in fatty acid biosynthesis in mycobacteria
S	S146	PMID:9634230	Its genetic organization, with two clustered ketoacyl synthases, resembles that of type II aromatic polyketide biosynthetic gene clusters, such as those for actinorhodin, tetracycline and tetracenomycin in Streptomyces species
S	S147	PMID:9634230	Mycobacteria synthesize polyketides by several different mechanisms. A modular type I system, similar to that involved in erythromycin biosynthesis23, is encoded by a very large operon,  ppsABCDE, and functions in the production of phenolphthiocerol5.
S	S149	PMID:10688204	A member of the family of contact-dependent haemolysins found in pathogenic Serpulina and Mycobacterium species11 (Cj0588), a putative integral membrane protein with a haemolysin domain (Cj0183) and a phospholipase (pldA) were also identified.
S	S150	PMID:26358298	There are two types of terminal oxidases in AAB: cytochrome ba3/bo3-type ubiquinol oxidase and bd-type oxidase, which consist of four subunits encoded by the cyoABCD operon (synonym: cyaBACD) and two subunits encoded by cydAB genes, respectively. Cytochrome ba3/bo3-type ubiquinol oxidase is a member of the haeme–copper oxidase superfamily, which includes cytochrome c oxidase in aerobic respiration of mitochondria and aerobes.4
S	S151	PMID:26358298	Taken together with the phylogenetic analysis presented in Fig. 2, it appears that As. bogorensis and Ga. diazotrophicus gained an extra nuo gene, possibly by the horizontal gene transfer, and As. bogorensis and Go. oxydans lost one nuo operon that is common among AAB.
S	S152	PMID:28223374	Despite this, however, blaNMC-A/IMI-type genes have rarely been found outside Enterobacter, which is likely due to their rarity overall, the low likelihood of being mobilized to a plasmid (via insertion sequences), and potential plasmid instability in other genera, as putatively shown for pIMI-5 in E. coli.
S	S153	PMID:23408754	Analysis of KEGG orthology uncovered the complete inability of Candidatus L. asiaticus and Candidatus L. solanacearum to synthesize histidine, tryptophan, and thiamine, as well as a severely reduced ability to produce phenylalanine and tyrosine when compared to L. crescens. Candidatus L. asiaticus and Candidatus L. solanacearum both possess 2 out of the 12 enzymes required for phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis. To compensate, all three species possess a general L-amino acid ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter.
S	S154	PMID:23408754	Also, Candidatus L. asiaticus and Candidatus L. solanacearum possess a thiamine ABC transporter not found in L. crescens, presumably to compensate for the inability to synthesize thiamine.
S	S155	PMID:18364359	Since then, genome projects of bacteria have predicted that type III PKSs are distributed widely not only in Streptomyces but also other various bacteria.
S	S156	PMID:18364359	For example, ArsB and ArsC, both of which are type III PKSs in Azotobacter vinelandii, catalyze the synthesis of alkylresorcinols and alkylpyrones, respectively, which are essential for encystment as the major lipids in the cyst membrane
S	S157	PMID:16330755	Salinibacter has a full complement of fermentative components and genes involved in transport and degradation of organic compounds. A chitinase, two cellulases, one amylase, a pectinase, and several proteases and lipases were among the polymer-degrading enzymes encoded on the chromosome. Additionally, the plasmid encodes a 1,4-β-cellobiosidase homolog.
S	S158	PMID:16330755	Genes related to the transport and metabolism of glycerol and glycine betaine (the most common compatible solutes found in more moderate halophiles and halotolerant species) were also present.
S	S159	PMID:16330755	Like the haloarchaea, Salinibacter has all of the genes for a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle and a cytochrome c-containing respiratory chain.
S	S160	PMID:16330755	It possesses a succinate dehydrogenase gene cluster (SRU_0484-0487) very similar to Actinobacteria and a second succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit, sdhA (SRU_2444), most similar to sdhA2 from H. marismortui.
S	S161	PMID:16330755	Similarly, comparison of respiratory chain proteins in Salinibacter indicates there are two clusters of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and II genes, the first with coxA1 and coxB1 (SRU_2099 and SRU_2100) and the second with coxA2 and coxB2 (SRU_0314 and 0313).
S	S162	PMID:16330755	In support of this notion, a nosZDF gene cluster and an oxygen-sensitive Cpr/Fnr-type transcription regulator (20) are found near to coxA2 and coxB2 in Salinibacter. The nos cluster encodes a nitrous oxide reductase similar to that found in a variety of proteobacteria (21, 22) and in H. marismortui.
S	S163	PMID:16330755	Unlike haloarchaea but like R. marinus (23), it possesses components of a cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase (ccoO and ccoN) (SRU_0323 and SRU_0322).
S	S164	PMID:16330755	Strangely, Salinibacter does not possess a ccoP gene, thought to be an essential subunit of cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase (25).
S	S165	PMID:16330755	However, next to ccoON is a gene encoding a cytochrome c protein (SRU_0324), which also appears to have been transferred from a β-proteobacterium and may substitute for CcoP function in Salinibacter.
S	S166	PMID:16330755	The existence of multiple trkA genes in Salinibacter suggests complex regulation of the Trk system, a feature likely shared with haloarchaea. This complexity is increased by the presence of yet an additional TrkAH system in the hypersalinity island that is most similar to that found in Firmicutes
S	S167	PMID:16330755	Genes with significant similarity to the Salinibacter insAB have been found only in cyanobacteria, Parachlamydia, and members of two archaeal orders, Methanosarcinales and Sulfolobales.
S	S168	PMID:16330755	The possibility that Salinibacter might also have rhodopsin genes, derived from the haloarchaea with which it lives, was one of the initial motivations behind the present work. Indeed, like Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and Haloarcula marismortui, and unlike any other characterized bacterium, Salinibacter contains four rhodopsin genes (Fig. 4A).
S	S169	PMID:23671678	In a preliminary genome comparison, presence of rhodopsin genes affiliated to the xanthorhodopsin group [13], [14] was reported for the Octadecabacter strains [5]. Rhodopsins are highly diverse retinal-binding and photoactive membrane proteins [15], [16].
S	S170	PMID:23671678	This implies that rearrangements occur more frequently in the genomes of the Octadecabacter strains than in other Roseobacters. Indications for intra-genomic rearrangements were mainly found in the genome of O. arcticus 238, which contained the most transposable elements of both Octadecabacter strains.
S	S171	PMID:23671678	In the Octadecabacter genomes, a high mutagenicity is indicated by an unusually large number of pseudogenes (411 in O. arcticus and 361 in O. antarcticus; Table 2).
S	S172	PMID:23671678	An importance of mercury resistance in polar habitats is also indicated by the fact that the corresponding gene clusters are conserved in the Arctic and the Antarctic Octadecabacter strain but absent in many other Roseobacter clade members.
S	S173	PMID:23148582	The percentage of IS elements in Anabaena sp. 90 (~2%) was comparable to that in other cyanobacteria, but less than in the bloom-forming hepatotoxin-producing Microcystis aeruginosa strains, in which IS elements comprised about 10% of the genomes[
S	S174	PMID:23148582	However, an abundance of pseudogenes has rarely been reported in genomes of cyanobacteria, except the endosymbiotic strain ‘Nostoc azollae’ 0708, which has an extremely high number (31.2%) of pseudogenes that were attributed to the genome erosion process
S	S175	PMID:22470573	Notably, in D. gobiensis, phrB and recB were induced immediately after UV irradiation, whereas the other Deinococcus strains lacked the phrB and recB genes.
S	S176	PMID:22470573	For example, the D. gobiensis genome encodes a Deinococcus-specific global regulator (DGo_CA2805) that is similar to IrrE, a global regulator from the extremely radiation-resistant D. radiodurans that confers enhanced salt tolerance in both E. coli and in the plant Brassica napus
S	S177	PMID:26305944	These sequences from soil and freshwater metagenomes (Fig. S3) suggest that Nitrospira with urease occur widespread in different terrestrial and aquatic habitats where urea is available (e.g., due to fertilization).
S	S178	PMID:26305944	Aside from passive diffusion, the transport of urea into bacterial cells is mediated by urea-specific channels such as UreI of Helicobacter (53) or by ATP-dependent ABC transporters such as UrtABCDE in Cyanobacteria (54). ABC transporters for urea consist of a periplasmic substrate-binding protein (UrtA), a dimer of the transmembrane proteins UrtB and UrtC, which form a membrane-crossing pore, and the ATP-binding and -hydrolyzing proteins UrtD and UrtE (54, 55).
S	S179	PMID:26305944	Although UreE is required for a functional urease in Helicobacter (57), various other microorganisms lacking ureE genes express active ureases
S	S180	PMID:26305944	Interestingly, in Helicobacter pylori two accessory proteins of nickel-dependent hydrogenase, HypA and HypB, are required for the incorporation of Ni2+ into urease
S	S181	PMID:26305944	In contrast to most other aerobic bacteria, N. defluvii lacks SOD and catalase, and its genome does not code for superoxide reductase either
S	S182	PMID:23291586	Primary candidates are MTBC-specific genes (Supplementary Table 4), including the prophage-like phiRv1- and phiRv2-encoding regions reported to be important for late infection45, the genes encoding PE_PGRS33 or other MTBC-acquired PE or PPE proteins known to enhance cellular toxicity46, the region encoding the polyketide synthases Pks8 and Pks17, the large prophage region in STB-I and/or CRISPR-Cas systems.
S	S183	PMID:15640799	We identified genes encoding a phospholipase C acpA (FTT0221) and a phospholipase D family protein (FTT0490), which may have a role in this process. FTT1043 encodes a macrophage infectivity potentiator protein previously found to confer virulence for several pathogens, including Legionella pneumophila23.
S	S184	PMID:31666316	IMP-type metallo-β-lactamases are among the most common families of acquired carbapenemases detected from Enterobacteriaceae and have been reported mainly in East Asia, including Japan
S	S186	PMID:28348835	The abundance of prophage may result from the lack of CRISPR-cas regions in any of the Y. ruckeri genomes sequenced. This is in contrast to other pathogenic members of the genus Yersinia, Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis, that have well-characterized CRISPR clades (Barros et al., 2014; Koskela et al., 2015), but similar to Y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica that also completely lacks CRISPR regions
S	S187	PMID:25091334	In contrast to Escherichia coli, C. glutamicum does not have the argA and argE genes, but instead possesses the argJ gene encoding N-acetyltransferase, catalyzing two different biochemical reactions in the L-arginine biosynthetic pathway
S	S188	PMID:22798451	One notable family of genes missing in both the M. prima and the K. olearia, but abundantly represented in other Thermotogales genomes (5–15 genes per genome), is a family encoding proteins with similarity to COG840 (methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins involved in signal transduction).
S	S189	PMID:22798451	Theba_1253, a divergent homolog of the other five genes in this family, is found in most Thermotogales genomes.
S	S190	PMID:22798451	An example of an M. prima gene-family-expansion through lateral gene transfer (LGT) is threonine synthase (TS) (Supplementary fig. S3). Mesotoga prima has seven genes from this family, including one pseudogene (Theba_0615), whereas other sequenced Thermotogales genomes have at most two.
S	S192	PMID:20219135	All of the gastric Helicobacter species produce a potent urease, as an acid protection mechanism, whereas the large number of enteric species (gastrointestinal, intestinal, hepatic and biliary) are not uniformly urease positive [7].
S	S193	PMID:20219135	The cag pathogenicity island of H. pylori is not present in H. mustelae, nor in any of the other helicobacters or campylobacters, including H. acinonychis which diverged relatively recently (ca. 200,00 years) from H. pylori
S	S194	PMID:20219135	The paucity of insertion sequence elements and bacteriophage-related genes in H. mustelae (Table 1) suggests that these mechanisms are not significant agents of diversity generation in this species, a process which is driven in H. pylori by free recombination [57]. Thus it was surprising to identify a CRISPR locus and three cas genes (HMU00230-00250) in the H. mustelae genome, as these features have recently been identified as a phage resistance mechanism [58]. CRISPR loci have not been annotated in other helicobacter or campylobacter genomes.
S	S195	PMID:20219135	HMU00170 Hag/Hly encodes a predicted 227 kDa protein with predicted signal peptide, and containing Pfam motifs for haemagglutination (Haemagg_act; PF05860), filamentous haemagglutinin (Fil_haemagg; PF05594), and an ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop). Homologues of this protein constitute a large family whose members are widely distributed among gram-negative pathogens, are annotated as either haemagglutinins or haemolysins, but which appear to lack functional characterization. The residue identity with HMU00170 is confined to the first 350 residues of that protein, and is particularly high over the filamentous haemagglutinin region (ca. 35-50% identity). Homologues of this pair of genes are lacking in helicobacters and campylobacters, suggesting this is an H. mustelae-specific acquisition among the ε-proteobacteria.
S	S196	PMID:20219135	Homologues of CiaB have been annotated in W. succinogenes and H. hepaticus, but not in H. pylori, which is curious because CiaB is also present in ε-proteobacteria isolated from sea vents
S	S197	PMID:20219135	HMU10120 is a homologue of proteins in other Campylobacterales which was first described in C. jejuni as PEB4a, and which is a major antigen and cell adhesin
