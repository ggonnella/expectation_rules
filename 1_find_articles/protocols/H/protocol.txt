# (1) Pubmed queries

The following queries were run on the NCBI Pubmed website:
```
  hydrothermal vent archaea genome
  hydrothermal vent archaea sequence
  hydrothermal vent bacteria genome
  hydrothermal vent bacteria sequence
```

The results (June 15th 2022) were exported to CSV,
and converted to TSV in Numbers (MacOS),
line ends were converted using tr and a newline
for the last line was added using sed
```
  pubmed-query-hydrothermal-vent-archaea-genome.tsv
  pubmed-query-hydrothermal-vent-archaea-sequence.tsv
  pubmed-query-hydrothermal-vent-bacteria-genome.tsv
  pubmed-query-hydrothermal-vent-bacteria-sequence.tsv
```

# (2) Join results

Since the results were overlapping, they were joined
using the ``join_results.sh`` script.
The result is the file ``pubmed-queries-joined.tsv``.
