#
# This prompt aims at a output format which is similar to EGC.
# The information is output as S, G, A, U, C and V lines.
#
# Differences to EGC:
# - there is no concept of document, since only a part of a text is given to the LLM
# - information which is obtained from different sources is not included, e.g.
#   the definition/symbol/description system for units, the model lines,
#   the description system for groups
# - some parts are simplified:
#   - there is only a single source for V and C
#   - tables are not considered
#   - sub-formats for optional parts, such as group portions, attribute regions, attribute relative units
#     are not present, instead this information is given always but in separate fields and as
#     a dot if not relevant
#   - complex definition formats, such as that for arrangements are not employed
#
# Keeping the output compact is important, since the output is otherwise cut in the answer.
# For this reason, the S contain only the beginning and end of the text snippet and
# C or V for similar cases (eg. single COGs when a list is given in the text) are not
# all explicitely output, but mentioned in a comment instead.
