               (10) biological_interaction ('endosymbiont', 'episymbiont', 'predatory', 'free-living', 'pathogenic')
                   # also mention the taxon partner of the interaction
               (11) metagenome_assembled (a genome name)
               (12) gram_stain ('+', '-'),
               (13) cultiviability ('cultivable', 'uncultured')
               (14) taxis (e.g. magnetotactic)
unit_types: |
            Type of units:
              (1) specific_gene: a gene, mentioned by its name
              (2) gene_homolog: homologs of a gene, mentioned by its name
              (3) specific_protein: a protein, mentioned by its name
              (4) protein_homolog: homologs of a protein, mentioned by its name
              (5) family: protein family, sometimes described, sometimes given as InterPro, Pfam, Pfam clan, etc
              (6) domain: proteins containing a specific domain, sometimes given as CDD, etc.
              (7) ortholog_group: gene ortholog group, e.g. COG, eggNOG, or named group of ortholog genes
              (8) feature_type: e.g. gene, CRISPR, repeat
              (9) function: function of proteins e.g. an enzymatic activity, a transporter activity, etc.
              (10) protein_type: e.g. glycoprotein
              (11) arrangement: relative position of multiple features, e.g. an order of genes in a cluster
              (12) gene_system: multiple genes, which together have a given function
              (13) gene_cluster: multiple genes next to each other, usually contributing to a common function
              (14) operon: multiple genes next to each other, which are related by transcription regulation
              (14) metabolic_pathway: genes which all together code for the proteins of a metabolic pathway
              (15) gene_island: multiple genes, horizontally transfered, often with a common function
modes: |
      Attribute modes:
        (1) presence: True if something is present (considered in its entirety)
        (2) members_presence: True if at least one of members of a set of something (e.g. genes of a gene cluster) is present
        (3) complete: True if all members of a set of something (e.g. genes of a gene cluster) are present
        (3) count: use this if something is explicitely count (e.g. 5), or a general quantity specification is given (abundant, rare)
        (4) relative: use this if the count shall be divided by a total count (e.g. rate of a COG = count of a given COG divided by all proteins assigned to a COG)
        (5) length: total length of the described unit/units (e.g. genes for a given function)
quantifiers: |
            Quantifier examples: (1) 'all'; most common value; output as dot '.' (2) 'most' (3) 'many' (4) 'some' (5) 'few' (6) 'none' (7) '>90%'
operators: |
          Operator examples: (1) '<' less than (2) '<<' much less than (3) '<~' a little less than (4) '>' more than
            (5) '>>' much more than (6) '>~' a little more than (7) '>=' more than or equal (8) '==' equal (9) '=~' similar to
            (10) '><' in the specified range (11) '<>' out of the specified range (12) '$' level (high, low, etc)
