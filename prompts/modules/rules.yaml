intro1: "Be sure to always respect the following rules:"
level: |
       If: <ReferenceValue> is unspecific, e.g. "high" or "low"
       Then: <Operator> is "$"
presence: |
          If: <AttributeMode> 'presence'
          Then: <Operator> is "=="; <ReferenceValue> is either "True" or "False"
one_unit_no_array: |
                   If: the rule applies for one <Unit>
                   Then: the entry 'unit' contains a string key
region_whole_genome: |
                     Rule: use a '.' to represent <AttributeRegion> whole region
                     NO: {'attribute_region': 'whole genome'}
                     OK: {'attribute_region': '.'}
svc_multiunits: |
                If for multiple units the same expectation can be extracted from the text
                (everything equal except for the unit name), then only define one record
                and give the unit names as an array instead of a string.
hint_vrule_presence: |
                     If the Attribute.Mode is 'presence', the Operator can only be '==' and the value either 'True' or 'False'.
                     Attribute.Mode 'presence'it should be used in V lines, and always used instead of Attribute.Mode 'count' or 'relative_frequency'
                     whenever the Value would be 0. Also use 'presence' if the text does not mention a number,
                     e.g. when it just mentions that something is present or absent.
hint_crule_presence: |
                     The Attribute.Mode 'presence' is not allowed in C lines.
