This prompt replicates in part the EGC format, i.e. the information is output
in S, G, A, U, C and V lines.

Differences to EGC:
- there is no concept of document, since only a part of a text is given to the LLM
- information which is obtained from different sources is not included, e.g.
  the definition/symbol/description system for units, the model lines,
  the description system for groups
- some parts are simplified:
  - there is only a single source for V and C
  - tables are not considered
  - sub-formats for optional parts, such as group portions, attribute regions, attribute relative units
    are not present, instead this information is given always but in separate fields and as
    a dot if not relevant
  - complex definition formats, such as that for arrangements are not employed

Keeping the output compact is important, since the output is otherwise cut in the answer.
For this reason, the S contain only the beginning and end of the text snippet and
C or V for similar cases (eg. single COGs when a list is given in the text) are not
all explicitely output, but mentioned in a comment instead.
